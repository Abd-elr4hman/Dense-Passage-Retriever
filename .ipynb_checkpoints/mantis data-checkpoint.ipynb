       "[{'utterance': 'I have a mid-2007 MacBook that, according to the Apple Store, has suffered some liquid damage and requires a new logic board to operate correctly, a ~$750 repair I\\'ve been told (would normally be around ~$300 were it not for the \"liquid damage\"). The unit itself works fine - the only problem I\\'ve been having is that the system does not recognize the battery and will not charge it. Curiously, the system can still be powered by the battery and even recognizes when the power cord is detached by diming the backlight, but I digress.Now that this laptop will likely become a desktop, I\\'m wondering if it might be possible to attach a desktop drive. I recently purchased a 2TB SATA drive and I\\'m wondering if it\\'s possible to somehow attach it where the current internal drive connects. Obviously the drive itself will not fit inside the device, but as the unit will spend the rest of its days on my desk, that\\'s not really much of an issue.My main questions are:Is this possible?If so, how would I connect the drive? Would a <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B0021SXRDG\" rel=\"nofollow\">SATA extender cable work?Is the SATA port on my MacBook capable of powering a desktop drive? Or should I just get a <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B002P6QIIA\" rel=\"nofollow\">SATA male-to-female cable and see if I can power the drive through other means (a cheap power supply, for example)The disk I\\'m referring to is the Hitachi Deskstar HD32000. Though I couldn\\'t find that exact model on Hitachi\\'s support site, these are the power requirements for a similar drive, the 7K2000 (2TB, 7200RPM, SATA II):<blockquote>  Power<br>    Requirement +5 VDC (+/-5%) +12 VDC (+/-10%)<br>  Startup current (A, max.) 1.2 (+5V), 2.0 (+12V)<br>  Idle (W) 7.5</blockquote>From what I\\'ve read, 2.5\" drives require 5V, meaning that my MacBook obviously is capable of producing it. The specs seem to suggest that this drive seems capable of accepting it instead of the typical 12V - is this an accurate interpretation of the power requirements? Or does it need both 12V and 5V?',\n",

Everything is on the back plane with in the Mac Pro, it is the same between all processor configurations.The  dual socket processor tray is where the changes live, that is what really what makes a Mac Pro what it is in terms of RAM, processor sockets, and QPI speed.In fact OWC\\'s upgrade services demonstrates the upgrade flexibility of the Mac Pro. Since <a href=\"http://eshop.macsales.com/shop/turnkey/MacPro/2009_2010_Xeon_Processor/Apple_Mac_Pro_2010_1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OWC offers a mail in upgrade service for this version of Mac Pro, where you mail the processor tray to them. They offer single chip upgrades where they swap the CPU and additionally offer dual socket options where they trade processor trays with you for a dual socket version. So all you need to do to upgrade to a faster Westmere Mac Pro is the dual socket process tray and the CPUs to go with it. And it looks like the processor trays are available for order from Apple as noted in this <a href=\"http://www.anandtech.com/show/2800/upgrading-and-analyzing-apple-s-nehalem-mac-pro/11\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">AnandTech botched CPU upgrade article for an older Mac Pro 2009 version. However ordering one might be a trail and error processes, since its probably not a common user part to buy.<blockquote>  Thankfully, the folks at the Crabtree Valley Mall Apple Store in Raleigh, NC are AnandTech readers and quickly understood what had happened. They ordered the replacement part and I waited. If you’re curious, it’ll cost a bit under $400 to replace the processor board in an 8-core Mac Pro provided you allow Apple to keep your dead board.</blockquote>',\n",

A MacBook and a MacBook Pro.Last night, my MacBook Pro up and died. I was working on it when everything froze up and shut down, and it won\\'t boot now. All indicators are that the logic board went. Whatever, **** happens. Sucks, but not entirely a loss because of my incremental backups, right?Wrong.Brought my work laptop (another Macbook Pro) home this evening to open up my Time Machine backups and retrieve any files that I needed or wanted to keep going forward. Or so I thought.When I connect to the drive, I can see two .sparsebundle files, one from the Macbook, and one from the Macbook Pro. In the past, I\\'ve been able to mount these as disks and manually sort through them without having to resort to the slow Star Wars interface of Time Machine.The .sparsebundle for the MacBook works exactly as advertised. The .sparsebundle for the Macbook Pro? Not at all. Double-clicking it gives the error \"No mountable file systems.\" Disk Utility (pictured below) has it greyed out and refuses to run any Verify or Repair procedures on it. I\\'ve tried the Googles, gone through countless discussion threads in Apple\\'s support site as well as other popular Mac tech sites, resorted to Terminal <code>hdiutil mount -readwrite</code> style hacking, all to no avail. As far as I can tell from the research I\\'ve done, what may have happened is that my MacBook Pro was in the middle of a Time Machine backup at the very second it went kaput, which seems to have locked the .sparsebundle into some kind of hyper-militant read-only state from whence not even light can escape.The message in the window pictured below comes up immediately after I click \"Repair disk\", though the candybar progress stripe keeps spinning and spinning indefinitely.I\\'ve got no ideas left. Extra sloppy-kisses may be provided as incentive if anyone can help me through this. I\\'m one step away from introducing the Time Capsule to the business end of the 12 lb. sledgehammer sitting in my toolshed at this point.',\n",

My previous modem/router (DLink DSL-G604T) did not have this problem. If I look at the DHCP leases on the router, the list includes the machine name, and this coupled with the fact that the Windows machines can resolve IP addresses makes me think this may be an OS X config issue (although I'm not experienced enough with it yet to know exactly what).

Anyway, after looking at a couple of forums, I wound up removing and re-seating the memory. Ok, then it works for about 45 minutes, but then the screen went black and again the 3-blinks of the sleep light. What should I try next in troubleshooting this machine? I have had no problems in terms of performance or other issues til today. The MBP is from early 2008. There was an iTunes update yesterday and otherwise no new software or updates. Also no external devices plugged in. However it did have the power supply connected. I did notice this morning that the power supply had come loose from the power strip -- possibly caused by a cat. This is the only thing that seemed to be a variance from usual.Thanks.Anyone? Links or tips on MBP diagnostics would be appreciated.\",\n",

Although it seems I can use \"open\" from the command line to visit it and then drag it to the side bar.So anyway.   Any \"best practices\" out there?I seem to have a choice to drag either /net paths to the side bar or to drag /Volume paths to the side bar.  The finder seems to implement the auto-mount functionality when I click on /Volume-based sidebar links.I could also create symlinks to /net paths and use those symlinks.One of the core problems I have is that the /net paths (and the /Volume paths) are long and unfriendly.  I\\'m looking for a way to \"manage\" these in a way that lets me use shortcuts or aliases of some kind.I\\'m still collecting tips.  When I get more, I\\'ll come back here and rewrite this.Basically /net paths are treated by the finder as local directories.  In some ways it treats them as local (must use \\'Goto\\' to open them) and in some ways it knows they are special (they don\\'t show up in the \"Mac HD\" location).If you have any other tips, please add them.',\n",

Having the server relatively close to me gives me an indication on it's usage by listening to the hard drives...

On paper it seemed like the best of both worlds, but I have to check for myself.

       "   {'utterance': 'No application will ever slide “on top” of the Dock. You can resize applications that might cover part of the dock and they will remain below the dock. If you move or hit the “zoom” button, the OS X window manager will automatically resize the window to remove the part that is covered by the dock. A different behavior can be observed if the dock is set to “Auto-Hide” (cmd+alt+d). Since the Dock is now a “temporary visible” object, windows will cover and use that part, regardless of the Dock’s visibility at the time of the resize.UPDATE: If the Dock is always visible, are you telling me that you can’t grab any window (in this example a Finder window) and drag it like in the picture? (The red arrow is the mouse pointer that the SSHOT didn’t capture). I was clicking and dragging below the dock.UPDATE II: As we started investigating, turns out that the following is true: If OS X has a secondary display attached and this display’s vertical resolution is higher than the primary display (where the menubar and dock are), then the Dock will let you resize “behind” it. I don’t have enough screen combinations to test exactly when this happens, but it’s clear to me that it only happens when there’s an external display. Next is a shot of my arrangement. As you can see in the picture, the “gap” between the big wide screen and the vertical one on the right is what I think causes the Dock to behave like this. It appears as if the window manager takes the highest vertical size when determining the bounds. I don’t know if this is a feature or a bug.UPDATE III*: Ok, for the sake of testing, I went ahead and modified my Screen’s arrangement (see picture). I exaggerated the placement because I wanted to make sure that there’s no weird offset acting. With the screens arranged like in the picture, my dock will not let me resize below it.This possibly solves the “mystery” of why does this happen. I hope you can replicate it and/or find a way to work around the issue. For the record, I rarely run into this because I usually either auto hide the dock or use <a href=\"http://www.irradiatedsoftware.com/sizeup/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">SizeUp to move/arrange my windows, and it doesn’t let me put windows behind the dock.',\n",

Let’s say one device is called: Headphones and the other is Display. The initial approach would be to create the Aggregate device in your Audio MIDI Setup panel, add Headphones and Display as devices, mute Headphones’ left channel and then Display’s right channel. Then happily select this new Aggregate device as your sound output and be super happy.Sadly that doesn’t work. (I’ve tried it). Apparently the clock synchronization between the “devices” doesn’t happen and OS X doesn’t really care, therefore only one device outputs audio. (Sad, but true).(more information on how to create an Aggregate device that can be found on <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/pro/techniques/aggregateaudio/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this Apple Article)What to do?There’s hope, but I haven’t tried this solution.The idea would be to create an aggregate device of your two sources (Display and Headphones) like we did before, then install <a href=\"http://www.jackosx.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">JackOSX, set its preference to your new aggregate device, start the Jack’s router, set AudioMIDI Setup to use Jack for I/O, open an app to play your music and connect its output send channels to whatever system playback channels you want in Jack Connection manager.That might work and I suggest you give it a shot. More simple solutions, might involve cabling, Y-Splitters and weird things which I don’t think you want to dive into (specially given that all the audio is Digital and internal, you’re not talking about external speakers per se).Finally, although it doesn’t provide simultaneous playback, changing sound sources is very simple with a free utility like <a href=\"http://www.rogueamoeba.com/freebies/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">SoundSource from your menu bar. (I do it all the time to switch from headphones to speakers).Hope something of this makes sense. ',\n",

If iTunes had to scan the filesystem for changes every time it ran, the program could potentially slow to a crawl.There are a number of tricks and third party utilities you can use to get around this behavior.  The <a href=\"http://musicbrainz.org/doc/iTunes_Guide#Updating_Library_in_iTunes\" rel=\"nofollow\">wiki for MusicBrainz Picard has some quick tips on refreshing metadata info, like using the \"Get Info\" menu item to refresh individual track information.  They also detail a small AppleScript that will refresh multiple tracks at once.As for adding and removing files, the best way to get around this is to not try to get around it in the first place.  Use the \"Add to Library\" and \"Delete\" functions in iTunes itself.  However, if you do decide to remove files without using the iTunes \"Delete\" function, you can use a script such as <a href=\"http://dougscripts.com/itunes/scripts/ss.php?sp=removedeadsuper\" rel=\"nofollow\">\"Super Remove Dead Tracks\" from <a href=\"http://dougscripts.com/itunes/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Doug\\'s Apple Scripts For iTunes.',\n",

       "   {'utterance': 'Numbers ’09 supports Excel native format (.xls) but it can’t convert from an Excel XML Spreadsheet. In fact, if you rename it as “xls” and try to open it (trying to fool Numbers), you’ll probably see all the XML but not the actual spreadsheet. Which is more scary than Psychosis II back in the 80s.Your only bet is some CVS or TEXT format, which excel can even export with Macintosh format for line endings and carrier return (if I’m not mistaken). The big drawback is that all format and binary stuff is automagically lost in translation (certain pun intended). ;)You’ll get the data, but not the format. Another alternative is trying to automate the Excel XML to Excel Native format, even if your webapp outputs a XML, you could try to “transform them” before anything else.For that, I haven’t investigated but you can start with <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?q=Convert+Excel+XML+Spreadsheet+to+XLS\" rel=\"nofollow\">a google query like this. There seem to be some Windows solutions, maybe something you can use/try. ',\n",

It is on a network drive. The .aplibrary file is 7.52 GB.I am importing it in-place, so as to enable other computers on my network to access the files as well, and in an apparently misguided attempt to prevent the local library from taking up too much space.To clarify, the .aplibrary does not even contain the original images, as the images are imported without moving.Looking inside the .aplibrary file, ~60% of the size is coming from the AP.thumbnails (4.9 GB) file, which seems strange as there are also thumbnails stored separately (In the /Previews/ folder).I have changed the preview quality settings to 2 (out of 10) with little effect on the size of the aplibrary file.This seems so ludicrous that I've actually completely deleted the local library, and re-run the import process several times, with no change. I can only think I'm doing something wrong, but I don't see any settings aside from the above mentioned preview quality which would affect this.I'm on a mac-mini with a 320 GB HD, and am eventually hoping to import my full library, which is ~280 GB, so this is a serious deal breaker.Further Info -<br>I decided to see what would happen if I manually removed the AP.thumbnails file. I opened the .aplibrary package, and simply removed it.<br>On restarting Aperture, everything seems to still work fine, though the thumbnails do load slightly slower.<br>This reduces the .aplibrary to 1.49 GB, which is at least smaller then the actual library files, but is still absurdly large.What the heck is going on? \",\n",

You might need to delete them first if it says they\\'re already up to date.Not much you can do about thumbnailsAccording to <a href=\"http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2934?viewlocale=en_US\" rel=\"nofollow\">this apple article, Aperture thumbnails are 1024x768 resolution JPGs, and I know of no way of disabling their creation. For low resolution images, this is obviously pretty silly/redundant, since the speed-up will be minimal. Other than complaining to Apple (that \"fixed size thumbnails even for low resolution images is stupid\"), I\\'m not sure what you can do here. :(I have a library of 34,000 photos which has produced 22 GB of thumbnails, an average of 680 kB per thumbnail. For your 12,000 photos 4.9 GB of thumbnails its about 430 kB per thumbnail. This overhead doesn\\'t really bother me, because my 12 megapixel JPG images are 2-5 MB each (and RAWs are more like 20 MB), but for a library of smaller (say 2 to 5 megapixel) images, the thumbnails aren\\'t that much smaller than the masters...Just a warning, that according to posts like <a href=\"http://brettgrossphotography.com/2008/04/24/aperture-library-slimming-the-size\" rel=\"nofollow\">this one, Aperture will slowly regenerate your thumbnails, so while you can delete them to save space, they\\'ll slowly come back.If you\\'ve only tried with your smaller photos from an older camera, and your newer one has bigger files, then you\\'ll see a big improvement in the amount of space \"wasted\" in thumbnails once you put the larger photos in. 280 GB of 288 kB photos seems unlikely (1.3 million photos?!) so I\\'m guessing you\\'ve got some much larger images in there... in which case it might be okay in the long run...Should be easy enough to calculate the Aperture thumbnail waste from the total number of images multiplied by about 500 kB per thumb.',\n",

The guide you linked clearly says: <blockquote>  Important: This document is intended for use by security  professionals in sensitive  environments. Implementing the  techniques and settings found in this  document impacts system functionality  and may not be appropriate for every  user or environment.    If you’re using this guide, you  should be an experienced Mac OS X  user, be familiar with the Mac OS X  user interface, and have experience  using the Terminal application’s  command-line interface. You should  also be familiar with basic networking  concepts. Some instructions in this  guide are complex, and use could cause  serious effects on the computer and  its security. These instructions  should only be used by experienced Mac  OS X users, and should be followed by  thorough testing.</blockquote>So clearly these “good” documents are not that good for everybody. In any case,Spotlight doesn’t index /System because that could be a security problem on its own (it would need permissions to do that, a set of permissions that you don’t want to give to a userland daemon running all the time, with access to a UI). Why would a regular user want to keep an index of /System remains a mystery to me, it only has things that are for the System and not for the user to find and manipulate. You can, however, use the terminal to touch that if that’s what you want, but no user should ever attempt to land in /System, it can only break so many things…Where did you get the idea that /System is the most important place to keep an eye on files ?Spotlight is a tool to keep an eye on files?The place to keep an eye on files is in your very own /Users/YourFolder, because that’s all the access you should have (to write that is).Spotlight is an indexing/searching tool, not a tool to monitor files that may seem suspicious in reserved system places. All in all, if you still want those docs, I’m sure that most of them will be available in the developer’s area of Apple’s website.  (developer.apple.com). You can create a free account and start from there. On the other hand, if you are a “security professional” then you are using the wrong tools for your job. Spotlight is ok as it is, if anything, you might want to restrict it. I’m sure that if you make spotlight run as root it will eventually index that, but of all the possible ideas that come to my mind, that is probably one of the worst security ideas ever conceived. There’s a reason why root user is disabled by default, there’s a reason for sudo and there’s a reason for normal accounts. Use them wisely, use them in peace. ',\n",

So, it looks like a <a href=\"http://www.sonyericsson.com/cws/products/accessories/overview/mbr-100\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sony Ericsson MBR-100 wireless dongle attached to the computer should do the trick. I\\'ve never used it (or even heard of it before today) but it sounds like it should work. The reason the computer doesn\\'t work is that both the computer support the A2DP profile but both as a server but not as a receiver. There might be a software solution to get the Mac to support A2DP as a client but I don\\'t know of one.Another option which doesn\\'t quite do what you want but might be useful would be to use the <a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/remote/id284417350?mt=8\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Remote app on your iPhone to control your iTunes library remotely.

Spotlight, however, is a different beast. In trying to replicate your scenario, I’ve found that I have two “artists” that are similar in name: Metallica and Metalium. They both contain “Meta” in their names.So when I search for artist “meta” I get both, which is annoying, because I really don’t like Metalium that much…So I have two solutions for you:a. Use Launchbar (or quicksilver), to quickly find the artist (this is a nice way to do it and what I really use most of the time when I want to find a song or an artist, it works faster than anything else). I use Launchbar. Pressing enter there creates a temporary playlist (called Launchbar) that contains all the tracks in question, but you could have dig a little bit more if you wanted an album or song. Very easy.b. Use Spotlight: This brings both bands: <pre><code>kind:mp3 author:meta</code></pre>but this excludes the unwanted one:<pre><code>kind:mp3 author:meta NOT author:metalium</code></pre>Not the best but… what can we do :)',\n",

Please note that the blog explains how to add more than one location to the search, not how to exclude (something I don’t believe is possible).So, the short version: Save your smart folder, the search location is really not important (we’re going to change it!) but make sure you use the searching “terms” that you want. Name it something like: IHATESMARTFOLDERS. Ok, you can name it differently if ya wish ;)Go to your <code>~/Library/Saved Searches</code> and you should see your saved smart folder. Once you have located your smart Folder, you have to open it with a text editor like <a href=\"http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">TextWrangler (or anything that can save Plain Text). Do not use <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/iwork/pages/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pages…Once you have it in your favorite editor, go to the end. You’ll see something like this: <blockquote><pre><code>&lt;key&gt;FXScopeArrayOfPaths&lt;/key&gt;&lt;array&gt;           &lt;string&gt;/Users/martin/Desktop&lt;/string&gt;&lt;/array&gt;</code></pre></blockquote>Note My smart folder was created for searching on my Desktop.Good. As you can see the path is in an Array. If you know something about arrays, you’ll know that they are a collection of items. This means we can go ahead and add more items to this particular collection:For example: <pre><code>&lt;key&gt;FXScopeArrayOfPaths&lt;/key&gt;&lt;array&gt;         &lt;string&gt;/Users/martin/Desktop&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;string&gt;/Users/martin/Pictures/MacStuff&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;string&gt;/Users/martin/Pictures/Me&lt;/string&gt;&lt;/array&gt;</code></pre>I have added two more folders to my smart -not so smart- folder. Now in order for this to start working you have to: Save the smart folder (remember to use plain text!)Restart Finder. And voilà. Sadly, I haven’t found a way to exclude a location.  ',\n",

I also discovered that I could do what I needed using the UI - after years with OS X I just discovered today that searches will be particular to the icon one has selected in the sidebar.  Your method may help me in the future - I am using smart folders as a daily planner - I really like it - I can make file names containing several key words (tags) and then use pre-defined smart folders like SaDec25 for that particular day or LA_EVENTS for all appointments I might have in LA.  Working out real well.  Thank again, AllanThanks again for the help. Do you know if the query language for smartfolders can do a boolean  ?  I would like a smartfolder that would include the files meeting a criteria OR a 2nd criteria.  Only  seems possible in smartfolders but this won't get me to where I need to go.\",\n",

       "   {'utterance': 'You are in Brazil (so am I), so you can\\'t just dial the \"+\" in front of the country code. You need to dial \"00\" and the CSP (the long distance operator code).What happens is that some operators (Oi and Claro, for sure) have a JavaCard application in the SIM card that intercepts every call you place and before send the dialed number to the network verifies if you are in a situation that you should need to add a CSP or not, and adds the operators own CSP in that case, if there isn\\'t one in the dialed number.So, for example, if I\\'m in Rio (area code 21) and dial a call to (24) 9999-8888, which is a long distance call, the application will add \"0\"+  to my number. The same if I\\'m in Petrópolis (area code 24), since my MSISDN is from Rio.On the other side, if I register my phone numbers using the international notation, the application is smart enough to remove the \"+\" and the country code and add the \"0\" and the CSP, unless it realizes that you\\'re roaming abroad.Besides Oi and Claro, I would guess that Vivo also uses an application like that, since it buys SIM cards from the same manufacturers. TIM has a different application in their SIM cards that modifies the phone numbers in your SIM card to add the CSP 41. It is a lame solution and I regret every time I have to use a TIM mobile.If it is enough for you to have an application like TIM\\'s, there are at least two in the brazilian App Store that will edit the iPhone\\'s Address Book:[Minha Operadora](http://itunes.apple.com/br/app/minha-operadora/id401640256?mt=8)[DDD Fácil](http://itunes.apple.com/br/app/ddd-facil/id381994693?mt=8)I haven\\'t tested either, so I can\\'t offer advice on how well they work.Otherwise, you will probably have to go back to an operator that offer that application in the SIM card (there is no way for a user to add apps to their SIM card by themselves).',\n",

Most of the benefit of TechTool Pro and DiskWarrior is to have am emergency plan in place in case of hard drive failure. But that is to be done before the problem :)Back to your case, I suggest you give <a href=\"http://www.titanium.free.fr/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Onyx a try to check the status of your HDD’s Smart status. Assuming you don’t hear strange noises in the drive, performing a full Clone to an external drive using <a href=\"http://www.bombich.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Carbon Copy Cloner would provide you with an important piece of information: the computer can read your entire drive, block by block. Both Onyx and OS X can verify your volume so I suggest you also perform a verify (using Disk Utility for example) and verify your permissions. Finally, use <a href=\"http://applejack.sourceforge.net/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">AppleJack to execute some of the above tests to make sure that the OS is in Single User. If after performing all of the above, you see nothing “out of the ordinary”, you don’t hear “strange click noises” or you don’t detect any strange slowness in your drive, you can assume that the drive has not suffered any damage. But, all things said, I’d keep my backups up2date just in case. (You do have backups, don’t you?)I’ve had drives fall from a desktop to the floor and survive for years without any problems, and some drives tipped 0.5 inches and instantly died. Hard drives are like unicorns. :)',\n",

The only way to fulfill this request is;if the chosen dock connects not only via data, but ALSO via the headphone jack, and;that connection is a triple-ring connection, just like the iPhone headphones. Note that you\\'re highly unlikely to find this, because docks are for data/playing audio (which can be accomplished via the audio jack), the \"dock your phone and use the computer as a gateway to phone functions\" use case is, unfortunately, not present.Third problem:<br>The iPhone is too smart. A while back I was driving with my phone plugged into a line-in port on my car (for music), and I was received a phone call. I had guests in the car, all friends, and figured I would just let the conversation take place via the car stereo, and turn on speaker so the other part could adequately hear me. No such luck. When not on speaker, the call came out of the ear piece only, when on speaker, the call came out of the speaker ports. The iPhone will only use the headphone port for a call if it has a microphone attached.<a href=\"http://mirasoftware.com/BPE2/\" rel=\"nofollow\">BluePhone Elite was an option for this (with serious caveats), but it never had terribly good support for the iPhone. Only because of the limitations imposed by Apple. And, apparently BPE is dead now? What a shame. That was a good app for many many other phones.I\\'m (unfortunately) very confident in saying that you will have a very hard time finding this dream product of yours, and you\\'re better off simply plugging your own headset into the headphone port, or like balexandre suggested, pair a Bluetooth headset. A product like you want will invariably not pass Apple Certification, which means you will not easily find it in any mainstream store (not only Apple Stores, but BestBuy and it\\'s ilk).',\n",

If you are worried about your data while tethering or using a 3G iPad/iPhone then look at it this way, it\\'s more secure than using free/unsecured WiFi hotspots/networks.Really the answer to your question is that 3G is pretty secure, but it has its flaws.3G is encrypted, the most common encryption algorithms have been cracked, with the right equipment somebody could intercept your information wirelessly.  However, they would need some knowledge, some money and some motivation to do it.  Then in addition to that, they would need your device to send unencrypted data (non https) so it could be deciphered.  All in all it\\'s pretty unlikely but certainly possible that your information could be intercepted.  However, this is a risk for anyone transmitting data anywhere and is not isolated to 3G/WiFi or other mobile device communication methods.Try a google search on 3G security and you\\'ll find plenty of information on the flaws and security holes and how they might be exploited.

The easiest way to do it is with an application that we all have in the Applications folder on our Macs but usually don\\'t think of: Image Capture. Connect your iPad via USB, then fire up Image Capture. There\\'s a toolbar at the bottom of the Image Capture window with buttons that let you rotate selected shots 90 degrees left or right.Better yet, you can use Automator to create an Image Capture plugin that performs a variety of image transforms. The one I created first rotates the picture 90 degrees left (Preview action), then converts it from the native PNG to TIFF (Preview action), then saves it to a specified folder (Finder action). The plugin appears in the Import To pop-up  menu in the Image Capture toolbar.',\n",

Unless I\\'m wrong (and I may be, I\\'m only a beginning EE student ;) those numbers are smaller than the ones on the output of the solar panel. To confirm it another way, P=IV, (P is power in Watts), so theoretically P=7*22=154 watts. 154>45.The Nomad 7m has a 12v cigarette-lighter style outlet that will fit the MB Airline Adapter. The problem is that it puts out 12v (or so it says, but I\\'m hoping it\\'s actually around 14) and the Airline adapter needs 14-15 to work right.What do you guys think? Is this possible? Any recommendations for alternative options (I could always use a 3rd party vehicle adapter if need be). If it puts out this much juice it should also be able to charge a regular MacBook, I think.

Then, you have to take the efficiency of the Photovoltaic Panel into account. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_cell_efficiency\">Wikipedia gives us a best-case mono crystalline panel efficiency of ~25%, shich means that only 25% of the light which falls on the panel is converted to electrical energy, while the rest is dissipated as heat, reflected away, etc...Therefore, a 1m² panel will, at the equator and with a mechanism that points it directly at the sun, manage ~250 W.From this, we can tell that a 154W panel would have to be ~0.616 m² (154/250 = 0.616), far larger than what you have.Examining the 7W panel you have - How big does a panel have to be to produce 7W?7/250 = 0.028 m², or 280 cm² or about 14*20 cm, which seems pretty accurate, judging from the pictures on the product page.Anyways, I went of on a bit of a tangent here, because you mentioned you\\'re an EE, which is one of my main interests.',\n",

       "  'utterances': [{'utterance': \"I just recently got a MacBook Air and noticed that its battery life is much lower than Apple's estimate of 7 hours.Since it is not the same, I would like to benchmark my battery life right now (while the battery is fairly new) so that in the future when the battery feels like it isn't holding as much charge, I can know if it's due to the battery life diminishing, or if it's simply my perception that the battery is not holding as much as it used to.For example, say I find out that my MacBook Air only holds 5 hours of battery life today. A year later, I may notice that the battery isn't holding as much power, and decide I want to benchmark it. I test it again, and find out that its still holding 5 hours of battery (it just seemed like it was holding less). So while it's less than the 7 hours promised by Apple, my battery hasn't actually degraded at all, since it matches the same benchmark I used before. Thus, there is no point of replacing its batteries.I have several programs running in the background (BetterTouchTool, KeyRemap4MacBook, DropBox, iAntiVirus), which I expect to be running throughout my MacBooks life. Do you think that when performing these battery benchmarks I should quit these applications or leave them running? My guess is that I should quit as many applications as possible to reduce the chance that one of them won't behave exactly the same between benchmarks.Ideally I want the benchmark to not last a long time so that I don't waste time benchmarking, however, at the same time, I don't want to overheat the battery which could cause permanent damage.Ideally the benchmark should not require me to be present at the computer and use it constantly (this would mean that I would need to temporarily disable the sleep timers), since then it wouldn't actually reflect a reproducible benchmark (e.g. if I need to use Facebook for 5 hours constantly during each benchmark, its VERY unlikely that I will do the exact same thing during both benchmarks... not to mention that Facebook's code a year later may be less or more efficient, causing more or less battery usage). Thus, I'm thinking an automated program which keeps using the battery at a consistent rate would be the best tool for the job.Also, how would I know how long the battery lasted? I don't want to sit near the computer and constantly monitor if it's still on or not. I want to be able to set it and forget it. Then after recharging it, it will inform me of how long the battery lasted.Do you have any suggestions for things that might help perform these kind of benchmarks?\",\n",

I sync my phone about once every two weeks or so which for a lot of my daily podcasts is not good.  For twit there's a decent mediafly app that is specifically for twit but it seems buggy - when you go back to listening to a podcast after stopping for a while it goes back in time and will skip back anywhere from 30 or so seconds to about 20 mins and  you then have to scrub to find out where you were.  There is also a standalone mediafly app that is supposed to be for alternate podcast locations but it doesn't seem to do a good job handling the RSS and misses quite a bit plus it has some of the same bugs as the twit version.  Also as with any background audio api (aside from the iTunes app) they never properly are able to display the right info on the lock screen - some times it shows the title of the app, sometimes it shows the last thing you were playing in itunes (even though it doesn't play that and plays what you want it to), sometimes it's blank - and it never shows the artwork.Right now I've resorted to subscribing via iTunes on mac, then on my iPhone go to the podcast, get more episodes and them download from there. It works but it sucks if I'm away from wifi when I want to do that as there is still the 20 meg limit.  I'd settle for a single download limit going away and a button to download all new episodes being wifi onlyWhat I would like ideally is to press one button that will download all of the latest versions of my podcasts to the itunes app - this isnt likely to happen.  Failing that I'd like to have an app that lets me do the same thing, download the latest episodes with a single button, delete older episodes automatically, play nicely in the background, and have a good browser/management interface.\",\n",

You can then add tracks from any of the libraries and have requests and votes for next tracks sent via the Remote app for iPhone or just shouted across the office.May still not be quite what you\\'re after, but essentially uses features already available in iTunes rather than a 3rd Party app to do it for you.--You could try having one folder for music and all linking to it, but you may hit permission issues or DRM or something silly like that.<a href=\"http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1203\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1203This tells you how to move the library to a shared folder for one computer to allow multiple users to connect to it, the actual library is still per user, so you may get duplicate files or have to update the library if new files are added. In theory this would allow multiple computers to connect to one collection of music, add to it and play the files others have added. Though my theory is untested and may be flawed (like all good theories).On a different note:I was able to have one library (so viewing the same apps, podcasts, music etc. without the need to update it each time you logged in or downloaded new stuff) for multiple users on one computer by copying the whole iTunes folder to the shared folder and then adding an alias to the shared iTunes folder in the Music folder for each users Home folder - which is a bit of a convoluted sentence - which may be of some help, but probably not as the library gets locked when it\\'s accessed by a user, so i can\\'t imagine it\\'d help for multiple computers.

With the noise canceling engaged and some quiet music playing, almost all outside noise goes away completely. They are comfortable enough that I can wear them for several hours and feel no discomfort. They cost about $300. The only negative is that in order to play music, you must have the noise canceling feature turned on which requires a battery. So if you happen to be on the road (say, in an airplane) and your battery dies, you are SOL. So definitely make sure you have a spare charged AAA battery nearby.Aesthetic looks were never that important to me, but from comparing the other products you list, the Bose headset looks very similar so it should satisfy you in that department. Good luck with your decision!',\n",

I contacted Bose and I was able to replace them at a slight discount by shipping them my broken ones. So I am on pair number 2 in about 6 years. I am more careful when I travel with them now. I think they are relatively sturdy so long as you don't abuse them and you use the included case if you travel.update: I just noticed that the padding around the earphones has started wear and degrade.

       "  'utterances': [{'utterance': \"I have a white MacBook (MacBook4,1). I have owned and used it for over two years now (30 months, as coconutBattery would have me believe). coconutBattery and Battery Health Monitor both report that the capacity of the battery has gone down to 82% at 4123 mAH charge capacity (with design charge capacity being 5020 mAH). The load cycles (cycle count) is 376, and the battery is reported to be in normal condition. Naturally, the battery drains faster now than it did, say, a year ago, or when it was brand spanking new. I don't mind that. That's understandable. What I do mind, however, and what perplexes me is that, after the battery is drained all the way down to around 30%, the MacBook shuts off in a split second. I can hear that familiar click sound from the hard-disk that comes when the power button is held down for a few seconds to forcefully shut down the system. It took me by surprise when I first experienced it. I thought that perhaps it went to sleep because the battery may have drained completely. But it never displayed any alert about low battery (the charge was still reported to be around 30% when the event happened). When I pressed the power button, the MacBook did a POST and started as it would after a cold shut-down. It happened to me every time I had drained the battery down to around 30%. I would think that the electronics on board the battery controller would force the system to go into hibernate (suspend/sleep) mode, while making sure there is just enough charge left to keep the system memory alive somewhere. However, as far as I can tell, obviously, the controller has no reason to think the remaining charge (at 30%) on the battery is appallingly low to warrant any such operations. But, it is as if the battery suddenly abruptly completely shuts itself off, as if its connection gets severed off there in a second. I am clearly out of any warranty. But, I would like to know what could be the problem here. The battery is dying, but at 82% capacity, I shouldn't think so. What do you people think?\",\n",

You will need to use the 10.211.55.2 address to connect to your Mac. Note that this is not the same as the Gateway address.It is also worth pointing out that the IP address for the Parallels network is assigned via DHCP and has the potential to change. This means that you would need to change the entries in your hosts file.*And finally, make sure that Apache is listening on the Parallels Network IP address. The default configuration should listen on all ports, but would be worth checking if you have changed the Apache configuration.*There are <a href=\"http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20070817025358357\">instructions here to change the Parallels network adapter on the Mac to use a specific address, but this is for Tiger.',\n",

But the internal Bluetooth never worked very well and finally quit completely (after the one-year warranty expired, of course). I didn't care too much because I didn't like the Bluetooth mouse I had and didn't mind using the USB Mighty Mouse that came with it.Well, the Mighty Mouse trackball died for good (no amount of cleaning has restored its ability to scroll down a page, though it scrolls up just fine)  and the only new mouse I could get from Apple was the Magic Mouse. So I bought a 3rd-party USB Bluetooth dongle, which works OK, but occasionally disconnects my mouse for a while and sometimes requires me to use the USB mouse to reconnect it via the Bluetooth menu. Also I experience periods of latency that are intensely frustrating, especially when gaming.I Googled extensively and found diagrams of the internal Bluetooth. I examined the Bluetooth chip on the motherboard and found a wire was loose. I reconnected the wire but I still can't get the internal Bluetooth to work at all. I located a solution that would require soldering, but the diagram showed didn't look exactly like my setup, so I gave it a pass (I balk at soldering my motherboard anyway). I hear there were problems with the Bluetooth on my model, but obviously they are not going to get fixed for free by Apple. So, on to my specific questions:Is there anything I can do to get the native Bluetooth working short of paying to have Apple fix it?If I did get the native Bluetooth working, would it be any better than the 3rd-party alternatives?Is latency something you just have to live with when using a Bluetooth mouse?Does anyone sell new or reconditioned (perfectly) USB Mighty Mouses? I haven't been able to find any online except used models.\",\n",

This is no good, if you\\'re developing an application (a Django app) and you want it listening on port 80 during development (not using Apache). Can I stop Apache from listening on port 80 or disable it altogether, or is it required for OS X (or some built-in software) to operate?MOST IMPORTANT: For about 3 days I had a high-res 15\" but had to return it due to the fonts being difficult to read. I was able to cope with certain of the apps, but my code editor\\'s text looked blurry no matter the font size, and a couple other apps\\' fonts did as well. Is there a trick to getting your fonts to look crisp on the high-res display (such as how Windows has ClearType settings, etc), or should I change fonts?

Quote from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Visual_Interface\" rel=\"nofollow\">wikipedia article:<blockquote>  To support display devices requiring higher video bandwidth, there is provision for a dual DVI link. A dual link doubles the number of TMDS pairs, effectively doubling video bandwidth at a given pixel clock frequency.    Dual link should not be confused with dual display (also called dual head), which describes those situations where a computer is hooked up to two monitors at once. Neither, either, or both of the dual displays could be dual link. Depending on the video card(s), the displays could be both analog (VGA), an analog and a digital, or both digital.</blockquote>In order to attach two monitors, you could use a third party device like <code>Matrox GXM (Graphics eXpansion Modules)</code> - you can connect two or three monitors from your Display Port, however, there are some limitations (like the OS does not know natively that there are two or three monitors connected and treats it like one). The price is about $350 for the Tripplehead and around $220 for the Dualhead one.Here is the <a href=\"http://www.matrox.com/graphics/en/products/gxm/\" rel=\"nofollow\">GXM homepage.',\n",

Also, don't ask me to forward/import to Gmail. I have tried that numerous times - Gmail fails at importing filter rules or nested folders properly from Hotmail and it also has numerous issues with sync and contacts etc when importing from Hotmail.The Mail.app only supports POP3 for Hotmail which I hate because it is only local sync - I am looking for either IMAP/DeltaSync/Exchange (i.e. 2-way sync) for my Hotmail to work in Mac. I tried Postbox/Sparrow Lite/Outlook in Mac Office 2011/Thunderbird with webmail plugin/Eudora and none worked. I tried mBox for Mac and it worked great for about 2 weeks and now it stopped working with the new Lion Mail.app update. In anycase, mBox has been out of development since 2009. I looked at IzyMail but I am not willing to pay a subscription - I don't mind paying a one time fee though.Hotmail used Exchange ActiveSync which works well on my iPhone. Mac's Mail program works with many Exchange servers, so I am really confused why Mac Mail cannot ActiveSync with my Hotmail account which apparently supports Exchange.I just want a mail client that truly syncs with Hotmail. Information to a POP3 clients flows one way so the Mac cannot update the server with read status, reply status and more.I am willing to pay for a solution and I just can't find such a software! I am also willing to pay a one-time fee for an IMAP gateway too and I can't find any such thing either.Is it really that hard to get Hotmail working in Mac?\",\n",

       "   {'utterance': 'I think that the problem is your new ram. You have upgraded with <code>1333MHz DDR3</code>, and you should use <code>1066MHz DDR3</code> RAM. The problem is that the chipset does not downclock your ram to 1066MHz and when MacOS enters graphic mode, the machine freezes.The problem lies somewhere within the low performance (shared memory) graphic chip MacOS drivers. Under text mode, MacOS works perfectly. Running <a href=\"http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1509\" rel=\"nofollow\">Apple Hardware Test and testing ram (1333MHz) also works. I have been told that Windows runs also.If you cannot replace your new ram (it\\'s was hard for me to find 1066MHz 4GB SO-DIMMs), you can temporary fix this problem by inserting one slow (1066MHz) DIMM (if you still have it) and one of the new 1333MHz. This will make chipset run your MBP with the least common speed, and your notebook will boot.I have found and published a way to downclock your ram and fix this issue in this <a href=\"http://discussions.apple.com/message.jspa?messageID=13163020#13163020\" rel=\"nofollow\">Apple Support Discusions thread. I\\'m quoting myself:<blockquote>  It\\'s possible with a software Thaiphoon Burner (http://www.softnology.biz/) to modify the SPD EPROM (a small non volatile flash, located on the memory, containing information about it) IF the EPROM is not protected (http://www.softnology.biz/tips_pswprotection.html).</blockquote>If you decide to take this path of flashing the SPD EPROM of your RAM, I could expand this or make a new one question, to cover in details the flash process.',\n",

I enabled Internet Sharing with Ethernet shared to AirPort and copied the text of the resulting <code>/etc/bootpd.plist</code> file to a pastebin here: <a href=\"http://pastebin.com/gQVzARfa\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://pastebin.com/gQVzARfaThis plist doesn\\'t contain all the necessary settings (e.g. SSID for the wireless shared connection), so I\\'m guessing it won\\'t work on its own.  I\\'m still looking for the other settings and will update this answer if I find them.  (It\\'s possible some are passed in as parameters to <code>/usr/libexec/InternetSharing</code>, but I can\\'t find any documentation on that.)Once you have created the plist file, try running <code>sudo /usr/libexec/InternetSharing -d</code> again.  We may be able to work through this one error at a time.  At this point it\\'s really an academic exercise, as it would be far easier to reinstall your OS to fix your pref pane issue.  ;]If by some miracle it does start, I believe <code>/usr/libexec/InternetSharing -q</code> will stop sharing.Messing with your system files is always somewhat risky, so make sure you have a recent backup of your important files (I recommend <a href=\"http://www.dropbox.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dropbox).',\n",

Well, I tried to find a player in appstore to watch those videos right away, without converting them - I couldn't find any good one. Anyway I thought that converting all that files would be a solution. Then I could watch them in default player.For many reasons it's turned out not to be that straightforward and in reality is quite arduous task. First of all folders hierarchy - itunes just ignore that. I needed to find a way to put all that files into one directory without loosing their order (remember it's training video lessons, so it's very important). I've managed to put all files into one folder and named them like 0001_lesson.wmv, 0002_lesson.wmv and so on.Converter. I tried four different ones, I tried different settings, tried to convert into different formats. And still the folder that initially contained about 350Mb data after conversion grows into something huge with almost 1Gb data.How come? I don't believe that wmv is so good, that it can be several times smaller than other video formats. Maybe converters I'm trying aren't the good ones. Which one do you think the best? Is there any easier way to solve that problem? And please don't tell me to use streaming and airplay stuff. I watch those videos mostly when I'm in the subway.\",\n",

Run the Boot Camp Assistant in OS X as normal and create a partition when asked, then insert your Windows 7 disc to reboot and begin the process proper.Windows 7 requires the NTFS file system, so once in the installer just select your new partition (labelled BOOTCAMP), click on Drive options (Advanced) and choose to format it. Then select the newly formatted partition and continue.Windows 7 will begin installing, and once it gets almost to the bottom of its checklist, it’ll try to reboot. Now, if you leave it here, you’ll get so far and see the black screen. Any further attempts to reboot will bring you to the same dead end.Instead, restart and press a key to boot from the Windows 7 disc when prompted. Rather than running the installation again, choose the little option at the bottom to Repair your computer. Decline any suggestions that pop up until you see a list of options with Command Prompt at the bottom. Choose that option.At the Command Prompt, type DEL C:\\\\WINDOWS\\\\SYSTEM32\\\\DRIVERS\\\\ATIKMDAG.SYS to delete the default ATI driver, then close the window and reboot.This time, Windows should successfully initialise a more appropriate display driver, allowing you into the desktop. From here insert your OS X disc to install the relevant hardware drivers as you normally would, then run Windows update to clear up any leftovers.',\n",

Recently my hard drive crashed so I got a new 500Gb Western Digital AV-25 WD5000BUDT 500GB 5400 RPM 32MB Cache 2.5\" SATA 3.0Gb/s Internal AV Hard Drive. I registered the hard drive and tried installing the hard drive into my machine. When I try to partition using the disk utility it gives a \" Failed to partition ,I/O read/write error\". Interestingly for some reason the disk utility tool says that the hard drive is 3.6TB when it is actually a 500Gb hdd. Has anyone ever faced this kind of problem and if yes what is the solution?Alternatively should I go for a Hitachi hard drive?Additional information: When removing my old hard drive I somewhat damaged the hard drive bracket. Do you think that this damaged hard drive bracket is the reason?Any help will be really appreciated.',\n",

(It could be awoken by re-attaching the power cord, and it would be in the same state as I had left it.) After a few weeks, it would shut down instantly after removing the power cord.(Note: This happened a few months after I began heavily using a dual-boot of Ubuntu on my MacBook, as well as upgrading the Mac OS to Snow Leopard. This is a 2008 black 13-inch MacBook.)I assumed this meant that the battery was completely shot, so I just recently got around to buying a new one. (I know, I should have dealt with this sooner.) It just arrived today—I bought it from a respected eBay seller—but it does not appear to take a charge. One thing that I have noticed is that my computer now stays on for a few seconds after removing the power cord, then goes to sleep; when I attach the power cord, I can wake it up again and it hasn\\'t been powered down. (Just like the way my old battery acted at first.) However, my battery indicator still shows just an \"X\" where it should show a charge.I\\'ve done some research and found that <a href=\"http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1379\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">resetting my computer\\'s PRAM and <a href=\"http://support.apple.com/kb/ht3964\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">resetting the SMC have been known to fix these problems. However, I have done both—to no avail.One last thing: For the past few months or so, whenever I do software update, I always have a firmware update (pictured below) that never seems to actually be applied.I have pretty much deduced at this point that it\\'s probably not a problem with the battery, but rather something with the computer or how the computer interacts with the battery.

How can I disabled the A2DP profiles? There used to be a program called Bluetooth Profile Selector for jailbroken iPhones. However, it stopped working after 4.3.1.Here's the detailed scenario on why:<br>I have a stereo in my car that accepts a USB connector. This is how my iPhone is connected and plays music through. This way the audio quality is pristine, I can see the track information and control my iPhone from the headunit, and it charges my iPhone.The headunit also pairs via Bluetooth for hands-free calling. However, because the iPhone supports A2DP, this is how it pairs to the headunit. I can do hands-free calling just fine, however it screws up the audio coming from the dock connector. Basically, the iPhone will begin playing music via the dock connector until it auto-pairs with the headunit. At this point, the iPhone automatically changes the output method to the Bluetooth connection. Manually changing this back over to the dock connector every single time is not something I wish to deal with.\",\n",

Note that you'll be overwriting some files in the newer Mac's <code>~/Music/iTunes</code> directory. Don't worry though. That's what you want to do.You may also want to open up iTunes first on the newer Mac and do ⌘+, to set up the preferences as you like them. In 'Advanced' you should 'Keep iTunes Media folder organized' and 'Copy files to iTunes Media folder when adding to library'.Then shutdown iTunes and do the copy.__DOING THE COPYConnect both Macs with Ethernet cable. In System Preferences > Network you'll see 'Ethernet' on the left-hand side. You will hopefully have a green light indicating that the two Macs are connected properly and good to go. Incidentally you should ensure that the notebook(s) are plugged into mains power here.Note that <code>~</code> is a shorthand for <code>/Users/[yourusername]</code> so it can be used universally when giving instructions. In your case you need to click on the Finder (old Mac) and navigate to <code>/Users/[yourusername]/Music/iTunes</code>. In this sub-directory there'll be a bunch of files and directories including:Album ArtworkiTunes MusicPrevious iTunes LibrariesiTunes Libraryetc.You need to select all of this by doing ⌘+a. Once it's all selected you do ⌘+c to copy the files.Open up another Finder window. You can do this in many ways including 'control-clicking' on the Finder icon in the dock. In this second window, navigate to the corresponding directory on your new Mac. You'll see your new Mac on the left-hand side under 'SHARED'.You've done ⌘+c in <code>/Users/[yourusername]/Music/iTunes</code> and in the second window you're sitting in <code>/Users/[yourusernameNewMac]/Music/iTunes</code>. Click on that 'iTunes' sub-directory and it will be highlighted blue. Press ⌘+v.The process will start. Depending on how large your iTunes library is, and what grade Ethernet cable you have, you could be looking at waiting between 5 minutes to over an hour for it to complete.CODAOnce it's complete, you can ensure that both libraries are identical by doing ⌘+i on both iTunes sub-directories and comparing the number of bytes and items.\",\n",

I would love to be able to drag a video file into an application, specify that I want the Audio File in AAC at a given bitrate, click Start, and let the app do the rest.I am not averse to using Handbrake to suffice the conversion aspect of this, so long as the audio extraction after the fact is a simple process.

When the idea of sending binary files became a reality, the e-mail infrastructure was already in place and working and it would have been too hard to change it to support sending binary data (plus it would have added complexity). In order to solve the problem, the solution was to MIME encode the files (as correctly pointed by @mark in the comments).As you can guess, this makes the size bigger, but allows the binary file to be represented in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII\" rel=\"nofollow\">ASCII. Since ASCII has only 128 chars (and some are control chars!) because it was 7 bit, the 8 bit version, called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_ASCII\" rel=\"nofollow\">Extended ASCII added another 128 chars to the mix (allowing accents and some other tricks), but that\\'s just another story much better explained in Wikipedia and countless sites about it :)To create a simple analogy, imagine you have to represent the entire alphabet using only vowels. You\\'d start creating combinations of the 5 letters you have to represent the missing ones, so for example the letter \"B\" would have to be represented as \"AA\" (just an example), then C would be \"AAA\", then D could be \"AE\", etc. As you can see, I\\'m only using vowels, but I need more than 1 to represent consonants. This is more or less in simple terms what MIME does. It uses standard ASCII chars to represent a hell lot more, thus the increase in size. Hope this helps you understand the process that goes on when Mail (or entourage) says: \"attaching…\". It\\'s encoding the file :)',\n",

Fans are pretty easy to diagnose remotely since it\\'s almost always the fan unit failing (or when it\\'s not that, the next most likely cause is simply reconnecting the fan cable) so you can often ask for a parts and labor quote to help you decide what to do.You seem to indicate it\\'s the CPU fan. It and the hard drive fan are very hard to replace as you have to disconnect and remove the LCD panel, the logic board and many of the other parts. The optical fan is more amenable to a DIY repair. All the connectors are very delicate and if you break them, the cost to repair can be pretty large.

The <a href=\"http://images.apple.com/legal/warranty/docs/cpuwarranty.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">main hardware warranty has great links for getting service worldwide - since it\\'s quite long I\\'ll pull the links here for quick reference:<a href=\"http://www.apple.com/support/country\" rel=\"nofollow\">International Support Information <a href=\"http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1434\" rel=\"nofollow\">Apple Authorized Service Providers <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/retail/storelist/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Apple Retail Store <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/support/contact/phone_contacts.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Apple Support and Service Phone Contacts Worldwide <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/support/country/index.html?dest=complimentary\" rel=\"nofollow\">Apple Complimentary SupportLastly, don\\'t be afraid to run it for short time and low CPU use to get more information and be sure which fan went out. The CPU will reduce clock rate when it gets warm, then it will go to sleep for 30 seconds if that doesn\\'t keep it cool, next the OS will shut down (all of the above events get logged at default settings except maybe the clock rate). The CPU will also shut everything off abruptly if all of the above fail. Don\\'t run for weeks or hit the CPU with 100% tasks and expect it to last for years with the CPU fan off, but other things will have to fail for it to be a melt / fire hazard issue. I also wouldn\\'t run it needlessly and risk MLB failure needlessly.',\n",

Do check wired or wireless connection that is different than the one you usually use in case you have a hardware issue - but you should see equal issues in iTunes app store / safari as well.The only obscure thing is if your installed product database was somehow corrupt and the MAS is churning trying to figure out what is already installed either locally or for your account on their server end of things.You may have to sample the app or profile the network to poke deeper. If you are up to poking deeper, Daniel Jalkut stumbled upon a <a href=\"http://www.red-sweater.com/blog/1586/the-mac-app-store-debug-menu\" rel=\"nofollow\">debug menu for the MAS app. He notes that \"nobody knows for sure what these options do, and you might do serious damage to your Mac or your App Store account by playing with them\" so I would urge caution. Looking or logging the XML or clearing cookies should be harmless.Have you <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/support/mac/app-store/\" rel=\"nofollow\">asked Apple for support? I consider anything that prevents iTunes or MAS from working a billing issue since I want them to be able to bill me for my next purchase! Lastly, have you verified the date is correct on the troublesome mac?',\n",

       "   {'utterance': 'Overall, there are generally not huge problems using another mac to install the OS on to a target mode drive (same as installing to an external drive). The install will work fine and an OS will be present on the drive, but the areas where this will fail are:Using a restore DVD on a mac that is a different model (retail OS discs have all drivers for macs requiring a lower build number than the retail disk - restore media have a very specific model\\'s drivers only)If the <a href=\"http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1159\" rel=\"nofollow\">build level is incorrect, the mac may or may not boot properly - and some drivers needed for the mac that eventually runs the OS might not get installed.If the installer selects the wrong drivers due to the machine running the install being different than the mac that eventually runs the OS - you may have some problems.Basically, when a new hardware model is released (new thunderbolt, new logic board design, new battery technology in a portable) - that change is introduced into a separate OS build. I have never seen a public listing of these specifics broken down by model number, but over time these special builds generally get merged into the \"main\" OS.Since retail OS DVD change versions maybe once or twice a year, there is a window of time where installing the OS from a machine of type A and running that OS on a machine of type B will have issues due to needed drivers being missing from the retail OS DVD. This chance is much larger if you are using the newest macs and installing across product lines (MacPro to Air / iMac to MacBook).In practice, the core OS usually works and you can boot the mac and most of the hardware will work. Also, usually you can download the latest combo update and hope that it pushes updated drivers when it is run, but there is no guarantee that installing the OS on one mac will work for all other macs across the board. People that run large installations and clone one image on to dozens or hundreds of different macs can attest to the ways this breaks certain hardware from time to time. Recently, iMacs wouldn\\'t show a wifi card or produce sound when running an OS installed from anything but those new iMacs.For older hardware -  doing the install and running the OS - the chance of total success is very high. Stack the odds in your favor by ensuring the <a href=\"http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1633\" rel=\"nofollow\">retail DVD you use has a build number higher than the minimum build for the model you have.For 100% success, just make sure the mac doing the install is the same as the mac running the OS and use the DVD that came with the mac.',\n",

I would guess that this is how apps like ControllerMate modify keyboard keys, but I can\\'t say that for sure.You can use an <a href=\"http://wordherd.com/keyboards/\" rel=\"nofollow\">online generator for this purpose (it\\'s old, but the <code>.keylayout</code> files it generates still work under Snow Leopard) or a GUI like <a href=\"http://scripts.sil.org/ukelele\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ukelele (free).When doing it this way, you would add the resulting <code>.keylayout</code> XML file to <code>/Library/Keyboard Layouts</code> (for use by all users) or <code>~/Library/Keyboard Layouts</code> (for use by only the current user).  Then you would enable the custom layout in System Preferences -> Language &amp; Text -> Input Sources.For your third-party keyboard, it would still be tricky to find out the key code in a given mapSet for those \"useless\" keys for \"Back\", \"Forward\", \"Mail\", etc.  Personally, I would go with a GUI program that allows me to \"press and set\" so there\\'s no extra research or guesswork on my part.So in short, I am not saying that this method is easier or even more powerful than using an app like ControllerMate, but it should at least help explain how keyboards can be re-mapped under OS X without a \"middleman\" program that has to stay running in the background.',\n",

A solid, irrecoverable failure - flashing folder question mark, utterly invisible to Disk Utility, Disk Warrior, being housed in an external housing from different machines, the Genius Bar wonder disc (you knew they have one, right?), everything. So after testing my backup strategy to its limits, I bought a new drive (<a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B003V6AIWU\" rel=\"nofollow\">Seagate Momentus XT 500Gb). This drive is updated with the latest firmware <a href=\"http://seagate.custkb.com/seagate/crm/selfservice/search.jsp?DocId=215451\" rel=\"nofollow\">SD25 and I\\'m generally happy, the hybrid drive is everything you\\'d expect: nippy and reasonably huge. On a good day, my cold boot from off to active is less than a minute (much less). But. And it\\'s a huge but (and I have to assume it is something related to the drive): It is crashing on me frequently: daily, sometimes multiple times daily, spinning beach balls, unresponsive when the Mac\\'s lid is opened, failing when the screen saver kicks in; you name it, sometimes it could just be my typing something quickly into the Firebox toolbar. Fortunately turning it off and restarting has, up to now, always worked, but many of the apps don\\'t like it and many apps complain, fail and need reinstalling and I\\'m getting to the end of my patience. I\\'m pondering on just reinstalling Snow Leopard (or waiting for Lion or whatever\\'s next) and seeing if that solves it, but I\\'ve no real confidence in that as a solution. A little background: I\\'m a professional Windows developer and a Mac user for a number of years, so I\\'m comfortable with the idea of logging, tracing, debugging and so on, but I\\'m a little lacking in the deep knowledge of where to look for clues on the Mac. So I\\'m looking to the hivemind: if I\\'m not to just backup everything up and do a clean install, what should I try before that? Or should I just try that? Why should I believe that would work?

So zero out.Want install OS X into the new MBP - don\\'t need zero.\"Zero out\" is for the security. <a href=\"https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/15118/selling-a-macbook-pro-removing-personal-information-from-it/\">see here too. And if you come from the DoD, CIA etc.. ;) and you have classified informations on you notebook - use the multi-pass zero-out. ;)For those who have heard that there is someone who has seen such a person who knows how wear-leveling works, ;) TAKE IT EASY :)I show you how wear-leveling works when erasing a whole SSD sector-by-sector. (and not file-by-file). For the simplicity imagine than your SSD has only 10 sectors, with numbers from 0 up to 9.<br>Again, for this example we don\\'t need differentiate between static/dynamic wear-leveling, only need to know, than SSD somewhat counting the write-count into each sector on SSD.The scheme is the following:<pre><code>sector number -&gt; 0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 my DATA          .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .usage count      0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0 </code></pre>for the fresh ssd we have usage count \"0\" for all sectors. (in reality this is not true, but for this example it is ok), and we haven\\'t any data on the SSD.Ok, after a while of usage of normal usage of SSD we get for example the next:<pre><code>sector number -&gt; 0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 MY DATA          .  .  x  x  .  .  x  .  .  .usage count      5  6  6  6  5  5  7  6  4  5</code></pre>so, we have physically occupied sectors# 2,3,6 (so, my data ARE really in these sectors, and does not matter what OS think where they are) and the SSD maintain his usage table. You can see the usage table (bottom row) is nearly leveled. (why is not exactly leveled does not matter for this example, and also we not need discuss how SSH maintain the his free sector table, but need to know, than the SSD\\'s free sectors table has nothing with the OS\\'s free sector table).So, come erase the whole SDD sector-by-sector. What this mean? The OS will write some data (not always zeroes) into each sector sequentially on SSD.The OS send a command to SSD \"write these zeros onto sector 0\". The SSD\\'s wear leveling choose on block with the lowest number of writes and write the zeros into. In our small example this will be sector 8, so we get:<pre><code>sector number -&gt; 0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 MY DATA          .  .  x  x  .  .  x  .  -  .usage count      5  6  6  6  5  5  7  6  5  5</code></pre>I draw with \\'-\\' the written sector for the erase process. So the OS \"think\" than got erased the sector 0, but this is not true, because the wear-leveling erased the sector 8.Next, the OS want erase sector \"1\". The wear leveling choose the first sector with lowest number of write, so sector 0 in our example.<pre><code>sector number -&gt; 0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 MY DATA          -  .  x  x  .  .  x  .  -  .usage count      6  6  6  6  5  5  7  6  5  5</code></pre>for the sector 2 - got written into sector 4<pre><code>sector number -&gt; 0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 MY DATA          -  .  x  x  -  .  x  .  -  .usage count      6  6  6  6  6  5  7  6  5  5</code></pre>sector 3 -> 5<pre><code>sector number -&gt; 0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 MY DATA          -  .  x  x  -  -  x  .  -  .usage count      6  6  6  6  6  6  7  6  5  5</code></pre>sector 4 -> 8 (AGAIN got a write into sector 8, because it has the first sector with the lowest number of writes)<pre><code>sector number -&gt; 0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 MY DATA          -  .  x  x  -  -  x  .  -  .usage count      6  6  6  6  6  6  7  6  6  5</code></pre>sector 5 -> 9<pre><code>sector number -&gt; 0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 MY DATA          -  .  x  x  -  -  x  .  -  -usage count      6  6  6  6  6  6  7  6  6  6</code></pre>sector 6 -> 0<pre><code>sector number -&gt; 0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 MY DATA          -  .  x  x  -  -  x  .  -  -usage count      7  6  6  6  6  6  7  6  6  6</code></pre>sector 7 -> 1<pre><code>sector number -&gt; 0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 MY DATA          -  -  x  x  -  -  x  .  -  -usage count      7  7  6  6  6  6  7  6  6  6</code></pre>sector 8 -> 2<pre><code>sector number -&gt; 0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 MY DATA          -  -  -  x  -  -  x  .  -  -usage count      7  7  7  6  6  6  7  6  6  6</code></pre>sector 9 -> 3<pre><code>sector number -&gt; 0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 MY DATA          -  -  -  -  -  -  x  .  -  -usage count      7  7  7  7  6  6  7  6  6  6</code></pre>As you can see, after the 1st pass, (the OS think than got erased all sectors) but in the reality sectors 6 and 7 got not touched.In the next pass, the sector number 6 still not get erased. But in the 3rd pass GOT erased. In the reality it is more complicated, but the base principe is:if you erasing the whole drive sector by sector (and not at filesystem level, so not file-by-file), you will get leveled all sectors on writewhile you can not ensure, than all your files got erased on 1st pass, on multi-pass you can ensure this, just because of wear-leveling.Now i show, why some users get confused about the erase. Imagine:we have an empty SSD - all sectors has zero usage count. The SSD has for example 10 sectors.we write one file, what got written into the first sector on SSD because this sector is the first with the usage count 0. So the sector #0 will have usage count 1. (again, this is not true in the reality, because of inode table, or FAT tables at the start of SSD - but for the example is ok)so, the other 9 sectors are free (and has usage count 0). When you rewrite THE FILE 9 times, you physically got writes into the sectors 1-9, so after 9th rewrite your file is STILL IN SSD and possible to recover it. That is because you write only 1 sector at the time (rewriting only the space occupied with the file).in the SSD with 1000 sectors, we can not ensure physical rewriting of the file (with length of 1sector) either in 1000pass erase.But with the multi-pass erase of the ALL sectors (sector-by-sector) in SSD, you will get cleared all sectors and all sectors will have the same write-count at the end. (and the oldest FILE get erased first).Just ask, if something is not fully clear.',\n",

       "   {'utterance': 'In a nutshell - you are seeing the difference between a local physical network and the IP infrastructure needed to route packets out of that local network.Probably the iPhone obtained the IP address and the network via BOOTP instead of DHCP.The best resource for troubleshooting is <a href=\"http://support.apple.com/kb/ts1398\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this article by Apple. Since it is more general than your question - I\\'ll go on a bit in case to cover background and some concepts.The three bars means your hardware can talk to the base station hardware. It will pass packets and discover all devices connected to that network. Since some networks are not ever connected to the internet - you only need an address and a netmask but not the other information.Once the basic link is up, From a network perspective - the iPhone allows for three methods for configuring the IP4 WiFi network stack. Do note that IPv6 and other automatic route finding protocols like Bonjour may allow some things to work when DHCP fails - but you don\\'t see them in the preferences and not everything will work in this case.<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">DHCP <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootp\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">BootP StaticWith Static - you are on your own and have to know and enter all the fields by hand. BootP is an older method for a device to ask for network information from a router and DHCP servers typically answer either flavor of request transparently. (i.e. most DHCP implementations react and supply information if asked via BootP protocol too - DHCP has more bells and whistles, so it\\'s more common these days)It is a valid DHCP response from the server to send back any, all or none of the information so you really need to know how the router is set up to know if information is being lost or corrupted when it\\'s sent or if the router simply isn\\'t sending that information. In practice if the router is not received in the DHCP response the router sends in response to your phone\\'s request for DHCP information, the iPhone sends all information out to the physical device that answered the DHCP request and hopes for the best.In practice - I almost always see the routers field (DHCP option 3) filled - so the most likely problem when this happens is a software malfunction in the router or simple bad networking due to range, interference, overload or incompatibility.Many DHCP servers have BOOTP disabled and don\\'t answer BOOTP requests,as the client would end with insufficient information to connect and use the internet. Some client may use BOOTP at first and if it doesn\\'t work they will request the information with DHCP.With BOOTP only some predefined fields like IP address and network (subnet mask) can be sent to the client, but not a geatway needed to reach beyond the local network (Internet).DHCP has many options defined for the client, like routers (DHCP option 3) as default gateway to the Internet, domain-name-servers (DHCP Option 6) for DNS name resolution and many other.If you have access to the router or can experiment over time and with other WiFi clients (phones, laptops, pads) you might be able to tell if the router is overloaded/broken/interfered or if that\\'s just how it is answering DHCP requests - just with the basic information. In all likelihood - if your phone works on other networks, you didn\\'t somehow break it just for this one network and you can wait it out or try again (which helps if the root cause is temporary interference or overload), or stay off that WiFi until it\\'s fixed by the owner.Apple devices seem to use the last method used to configure the interface (BOOTP or DHCP). Furthermore they seem to stick to that setting for a long time, not trying the other method after a few failures.The best order for client devices to use would be DHCP first and BOOTP as a last resort. BOOTP nowadays is only useful for devices which boot (the OS/installation) from the network and even here DHCP should be used to get the full configuration of the client.',\n",

As in, You can only put (less than, due to OS and formatting, etc) 8 or 32GB (On a 8GB, usually you have a little over 6GB to play with, on 32 I think more like 29GB or so). The \\'time\\' capacity was just done using an average file size and the capacity. The same would be for \\'songs\\' or \\'videos\\' it can hold, like how iPod Classics were 20000 songs in your pocket. Some quick notes found from a <a href=\"http://16gbipodtouch2g.info/how-many-songs-can-8gb-hold.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">random site while searching:(For Audio)<blockquote>  Well first of all with addressing  overheads , indexing etc actual  storage space is more like 7.95Gb 15Gb  and 29Gb respectively .Generally  speaking , the number of songs which  can be stored on your device depends  on the filesize of each song.No two  songs are the same size usually , a  number of factors can affect this. The  two main factors affecting the size of  an audio file arequality( Bitrate and  bitdepth) and time ( how long the song  is). Therefore to predict the  number  of songs your 8,32 or 16Gb Ipod Touch  can hold , a few assumptions will be  made based on the average user\\'s mp3  listening practice. Here we will  assume each song is Cd quality  (44.1KHz sample rate) 128Kbps bitrate  and  4 minutes long i.e 3.75Mb per  song.   An 8Gb can hold about 2,120  mp3\\'s songs A 16Gb drive could store  about 4,240 mp3\\'s On a 32Gb drive you  could store about 8,480 mp3\\'s</blockquote>(For Video)<blockquote>  Typically you can get a DVD movie at  700mb when you download it. This gives  On an 8Gb drive you could store about  10 movies On a 16Gb drive you could  store about 21 movies On a 32Gb drive  you could store about 44movies You can  compress the movie down to a much  smaller filesize and it will still  look good on the small screen ,  allowing you to cram many more movies  in there. Apple claims the Ipod Touch   can hold up to 10 hours , 20 hours or  40 hours of video with the right  factors.Their claim is based on H.264  1.5-Mbps video at 640-by-480 resolution combined with 128-Kbps  audio.</blockquote>As you can see, its not really an exact science of capacity of time. Same goes for CDR and DVDR\\'s - the times are just estimations due to usual encoding and such. I think Apple dropped this type of information from its advertising/tech specs because especially with the newer devices (which may need more space for OS) it would look like the storage capacity went down (as in, used to be x number of songs at y GB\\'s, now x minus some number of songs at the same y GB\\'s). The only one I see it on anymore is the iPod Classic, and if you have one with that large of a drive, you probably aren\\'t counting much anymore either. In your case I would probably keep the larger one (unless you need the money), because its never to bad to have extra space. Update:Do to the updated question (wondering about HD video recording), according to <a href=\"http://ipod.about.com/od/iphonevideoandmovies/qt/How-Much-Iphone-4-Video-Can-You-Record.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">this site, one hour of HD video is about 4.73GB. So with the 8GB you would get maybe less than an hour and a half, and with the 32GB about 4 hours. <a href=\"http://whenwillapple.com/blog/2010/06/11/with-iphone-4s-improved-camera-and-hd-video-should-i-go-32gb/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Another site has even more information on calculations.',\n",

You may choose  to replace your battery when it no  longer holds sufficient charge to meet  your needs.</blockquote>That same page also says \"Charge cycles vary by use, environment, settings, configuration, and many other factors.\" So as an IT department, I would implement a charge/discharge cycle policy to which your users should adhere, to get maximum time and value from the batteries.My personal guess is that it will depend entirely on what apps you will be running, and what version of iOS those apps will require.

It was not able to find and download anything.I thought I could handle the driver issues later, I used Boot Camp Assistant to make the 500 GB harddisk Windows installable. Then I booted into the installer, selected BOOTCAMP partition and formatted it. Installer did not continue displaying 0x80300024        error.I run out of ideas and am rather frustrated.

I tried using the \"Airport Base Station Agent\" and when I connect through that or try to Map a Network Drive I get an error saying that \"NAME OF TIME CAPSULE\" cannot be found, check the spelling and try again.  In doing some digging, I discovered that my Macs are on the IP Subnet <code>172.16.8.xxx</code> and my Windows machine is on <code>192.168.216.xxx</code>.  And the Subnet Mask for the Time Capsule network is <code>255.255.252.0</code> (notice the 2nd to last is 252, NOT 255) while the Windows machine is on <code>255.255.255.0</code>.  Actually, when I run <code>ipconfig</code> the Windows Machine is even more confusing than that.  The settings I listed are for the \"Ethernet Adapter Local Area Connection 2\" but there is also a \"Wireless LAN Adapter Wireless Network Connection\" which is on <code>255.255.252.0</code> with an IP of <code>12.9.104.xxx</code>  To make it even stranger, I have VirtualBox running on the Windows machine running a Ubuntu server.  The Ubuntu machine is set up to grab its own IP using DHCP from the network and not use the Host Machine IP.  The Ubuntu VM running on the Dell has the same IP range as the Macs and the Time Capsule.  I have some ok experience with networking, though not a ton going between OS X and Windows (I usually use DropBox for file transfers).  Summary:<br>1 Time Capsule.<br>2 Macs connect to Time Capsule fine.<br>1 Windows 7 Dell connects to Time Capsule Network, but on different IP range and cannot see anything else on the network.<br>1 Ubuntu VM running on the Dell connects to Time Capsule network on same IP range as Macs and can connect to Macs correctly.  Edit<br>I forgot the strangest part (as if the VM thing wasn\\'t weird enough).When I use the \"Airport Utility\" from Windows (which was used to set up the Time Capsule initially) it sees and connects to the Time Capsule fine on IP <code>172.16.8.xxx</code>, but when I PING that IP...no dice.

       "   {'utterance': '<blockquote>  I would like to know if every YouTube video is playable on iPad2.</blockquote>No, not every single video but most YouTube videos are playable on iOS devices. It is not easy to determine which videos are playable other than just trying to play them. There are a few reasons why YouTube videos may not be playable: old videos may have not been converted to H.264 (remember before the iPhone, YouTube was all Flash) or the owner of the video may not want it to be viewed on mobile devices or embedded in websites.<blockquote>  Further does iPad2 play .avi or .mp3 or .flv videos ?</blockquote>Kind of. It will handle mp3 and PCM stereo audio in .avi, but not flv.<blockquote>  For example can an iPad2 play these videos -    <a href=\"http://online.itp.ucsb.edu/online/qcdscat11/arkanihamed/\">http://online.itp.ucsb.edu/online/qcdscat11/arkanihamed/    <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ3M3tp0GJE\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ3M3tp0GJE</blockquote>I can confirm the YouTube video you linked to works fine. The other link has a bunch of different formats but most of them are not playable. The flash links will not work. Usually mov links will work but these don\\'t look like they are H.264 and do not work. Usually 3gp works as well but I could only open it in OPlayer.<blockquote>  If iPad can\\'t play these then is there an app which makes it possible?</blockquote><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/oplayer-lite/id385907472?mt=8\">OPlayer doesn\\'t work for every codec, but it does bridge the gap sometimes. And it has a free lite version so it is worth the download.I think you should take a look at the <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/ipad/specs/\">official audio and video formats supported by the iPad 2:<blockquote>  Video mirroring and video out support:  Up to 1080p with Apple Digital AV  Adapter or Apple VGA Adapter (cables  sold separately) Video out support at  576p and 480p with Apple Component AV  Cable; 576i and 480i with Apple  Composite AV Cable Video formats  supported: H.264 video up to 720p, 30  frames per second, Main Profile level  3.1 with AAC-LC audio up to 160 Kbps, 48kHz, stereo audio in .m4v, .mp4, and  .mov file formats; MPEG-4 video, up to  2.5 Mbps, 640 by 480 pixels, 30 frames per second, Simple Profile with AAC-LC  audio up to 160 Kbps per channel,  48kHz, stereo audio in .m4v, .mp4, and  .mov file formats; Motion JPEG  (M-JPEG) up to 35 Mbps, 1280 by 720  pixels, 30 frames per second, audio in  ulaw, PCM stereo audio in .avi file  format</blockquote>',\n",

If that\\'s the case, it would seem that the LiPo drop from holding at 100% would be vastly outweighed by the fact you\\'re not using any charge cycles.However, this is a purely speculative assumption and I could find no evidence to either confirm or deny.If this is NOT true, and the AC adapter only goes to charging the battery, then there would be no difference. Your battery would drain to 99%, then back up to 100%, then back down to 99%, etc. Those micro-charge cycles would add up at the same rate as 100% -> 0% -> 100%, and you would get no gain. In this case the negative effect of holding LiPo batteries at 100% would outweigh everything else.Elaborating on Option 2There are lots of good reasons why Option 2 is the way it is:Because of known LiPo chemistry issues, holding a 100% charge for a long time causes the battery to degradeApple specifically recommends not to leave it plugged in all the time <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/batteries/notebooks.html\">on their websiteDraining a battery all the way to zero all the time is bad for the cell (Which is why ~10% is used)Heat is a killer, and when plugged in AND charging, you get extra heat that causes damage.There are a couple reasons why I\\'m challenging Option 2:It seems silly that the most intuitive use case for thousands of people that use their macs as primary computers is wrong.If the hypothesis in option 1 is true, you\\'re just burning unnecessarilythrough your finite charge cycles.It\\'s a pain to have to remember to keep plugging in and plugging out and be worried about whether or not your device is plugged in.',\n",

This page<a href=\"http://www.manpagez.com/man/8/InternetSharing/\">http://www.manpagez.com/man/8/InternetSharing/describes InternetSharing, a process which reads the property list com.apple.nat.plist stored in the /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration.First question:Why is the AirPort singled out with its own special entry in the plist? I understand the entries for primary interface (the source) and the sharing devices (the targets) But who cares if AirPort is enabled in this plist if you are setting up a NAT between Ethernet and Bluetooth, for example?Second question:Why does it allow sharing of Ethernet connection with Ethernet connection and then give you a warning that your ISP will hate you? (It also allows Firewire with Firewire) It doesn\\'t allow Bluetooth to Bluetooth or AirPort to AirPort; the menu entries for self-reference disappear.Third question:How do you change the default network when you share the Ethernet through your AirPort? InternetSharing configures the IP addresses for non-AirPort interfaces starting at 192.168.2.1 and the SharingNetworkNumberStart property allows you to change that. The AirPort interface by default is assigned 10.0.2.1. How to change?Fourth question:If you only have one Ethernet jack on a MacBook how could you possibly have more than one interface? InternetSharing configures the IP addresses for non-AirPort interfaces starting at 192.168.2.1, walking up by one class C network (subnet mask 255.255.255.0) for each subsequent interface, i.e. 192.168.3.1, 192.168.4.1, 192.168.5.1, and so on. Is this to address the possibility of a Mac Pro or an Xserve with multiple NICs?[SOLVED]1) the airport is not like the other interfaces2) the hard connections are less likely to connect to themselves-you actually have to WIRE them and nobody would do that3)edit the bootpd.plist4) usb adapterstnx. i solved the problem. even tho i turned off the firewall in the gui, ipfw was still running. sudo ipfw list gave the same list of rules regardless whether i had firewall on or off. dont know how i managed to achieve that!I looked to noobproof and turned off the rule for blocking port 80.

Firewall, nat/dhcp and networking concepts will kill you if you don\\'t have some good foundation on basic conventions and rules as well as how networks were designed to work.1) Why? I don\\'t know - the snarky answer is to ask the engineers at Apple to share their thinking. Rather than speculate - feel free to ask a more concrete question that can be answered.2) I don\\'t know about hate - but I get a \"you may disrupt the network\" since many networks assume each client is an end point - not a gateway to more traffic that it has to handle differently. You can break your mac\\'s connection as well as break the other people on the network. Your ISP won\\'t care unless you call them to fix a problem you created :-)3) Decide if you want to map out your network using DHCP or manually. Decide if you want one network or two. Once you read up on what a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subnetwork\" rel=\"nofollow\">subnetwork is -  you\\'ll see you likely need a software router to bridge addresses not on the current router\\'s subnet. The implementation depends on which way you decide to go.4) It\\'s called interface aliasing.

       "   {'utterance': 'To keep this general, here are some things to think about:DAS: Direct Attached Storage - Thunderbolt, eSata, USB 3.0, FW800, FW400, USB are the rough pecking order. FW400 is better than 100 MB ethernet, and FW800/USB 3.0 are equivalent to Gigabit Ethernet.NAS: The network matters - latency over WiFi can be a big bottleneck as can the controller chip / lack of cache in less expensive NAS.Think in terms of the bottlenecks - For streaming a song, AirPlay shows you what to expect - a slight delay, but the system can buffer the music to overcome little lags and delays due to network burps. DAS is much more responsive - especially for little file input/output as opposed to streaming a large file or song.NAS does offer some nice features like cross platform sharing and with a good network can be shared effortlessly with several clients that don\\'t mind sharing the speed of the device. DAS is designed for one user and optimized for speed - especially for database workloads like iPhoto.NAS can be harder to back up, where DAS works easier with whatever backup program you use on your mac.Your iPhoto database will be the last thing you want to move. It has no provision for splitting the large files from the database files and the latency of reading / writing to the NAS might make you feel the program is too slow. Try it out, but don\\'t be surprised if it\\'s the least responsive by it\\'s design.You want programs that can use local database and thumbnails on the fast SSD and store large original files on NAS or slower storage. <a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/aperture/id408981426?mt=12\" rel=\"nofollow\">Aperture works amazingly well if you find <a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/iphoto/id408981381?mt=12\" rel=\"nofollow\">iPhoto too laggy when stored on the NAS. I would start with the iTunes media folder - move that to the NAS and see how you like the performance.Then get a tool like <a href=\"http://whatsizemac.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">WhatSize or <a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/daisydisk/id411643860?mt=12\" rel=\"nofollow\">DaisyDisk so you can quickly measure what folders on the SSD are largest as you prune things down.You might find you don\\'t need all the audio loops from Garage Band or other surprising folders that make a difference in what you want to bring along on the SSD.Have fun with the tweaking - you\\'ll learn how things work. Also, it won\\'t be long until ThunderBolt storage is more available - your NAS might even have a DAS connection for when you really need some speed to access / move files to the NAS.Don\\'t forget to back up your NAS. <a href=\"http://www.crashplan.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">CrashPlan might be a great thing to try for that.

       "   {'utterance': 'To summarize...As in iOS, you can organize your Launchpad icons as you please using drag-and-drop. You can reorder apps, move them from one page to another, and even put them in iOS-like folders. Note that Launchpad folders are entirely independent from the /Applications hierarchy: creating a folder in Launchpad won\\'t create a folder in /Applications, for example.Your problem seems to be related to the fact that you\\'ve got so many apps. Again like iOS, there seems to be a maximum on the number of pages of apps Launchpad can handle. If you really need all 400+ apps on your Launchpad, there\\'s not much you can do other than reorganize everything into folders to free up some slots. But I doubt you need instant access to everything Adobe has ever installed on your computer, so you have a few more options to clean out your Launchpad:Delete apps entirely. There\\'s probably a few apps on your computer that are just sitting there, never to be used; you can free up space on your Launchpad and on your hard drive by getting rid of them. Apps from the App Store can be uninstalled directly from Launchpad by holding option/alt and clicking on the black X over the app\\'s icon.Any app can be deleted by dragging it from the Finder to the Trash.Alternately, you can use something like AppZapper to delete an app along with any hidden auxiliary files.Move apps out of Launchpad\\'s sight. Launchpad looks for apps in /Applications, /Developer, and ~/Applications. If you like those folders to be as pristine as your Launchpad, you can move your extraneous applications to a different folder. Launchpad will lose track of them as of the next reboot.Just remove the Launchpad icons. Finally, <a href=\"http://chaosspace.de/dev/launchpad-control-hide-apps-from-launchpad/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Andreas Ganske has developed a preference pane which modifies the Launchpad database to show or hide whatever applications you want. If you just want a clean Launchpad, option three is probably your best and easiest answer. Options one and two are there if you like to keep your /Applications folder clean, too: useless apps might as well be deleted, and your CS4 uninstallers could probably be moved somewhere a little more out of the way until you need them.Finally, you hint at having problems with having Launchpad duplicates. As I mentioned in an answer to <a href=\"https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/18518/double-entries-in-launchpad-mac-osx-10-7-lion\">this question, this may be a problem of actually having more than one copy of the same app installed.Hope this helps clear up some of your upgrade troubles!',\n",

Can I encrypt the TM volume in this situation, and will Time Machine be able to back up from those clients to the server?

They\\'re specifically mentioning Time Capsules and Airport Extremes. The issue Paul Eccles mentioned looks to be related to whether you can backup to NAS with Time Machine at all without regard to encryption status.The link referenced also seems to indicate you can\\'t use Time Machine encryption on direct-attached storage, but that may be because you can use Disk Utility to encrypted a direct-attached volume instead. Commenter Fracai calls out the classic standby of creating an encrypted disk image, storing that on network-attached storage, and mounting that for your Time Machine backups.I\\'ll also point out the discussion on that page (which is slightly inaccurate, but mostly on) wherein commenter TrumpetPower! cautions encrypting backups. This is a point worth repeating here. I\\'ll rephrase (more precisely and accurately) what TrumpetPower! wrote:The purpose of a backup is to preserve availability of data.The purpose of encryption is to prevent availability of data without the key used to encrypt the data.If you encrypt a backup, you add complexity to a process designed to simplify and preserve access to your information. With complexity comes increased probability of failure. Thus, the chance that you lose access to your backed-up data goes up. Do yourself a favor and make sure you understand when and why you might wish to encrypt your backups and think hard about how you\\'ll ensure you have access to your encryption key when it counts.',\n",

You can fire up iTunes - that online store should paint in about the same time as the Mac App store if your app and account are working correctly. It\\'s more like a thin version of safari that knows how to spend your money with a secure wallet. Any network filtering, proxy, date errors, or slow servers will cause your app to poke along.You could try signing out of your account to see if that is delaying the response. You could also try disabling OCSP/CRL in the Keychain Access preferences. That helped in some 10.6 slowdowns, but it\\'s not making as much of a difference in Lion as far as I can tell.',\n",

This created the “right gemset selected, but wrong installation of ruby” effect that disappeared after “cd out, cd in” (since RVM would have reasserted its position in the PATH at that point). When a shell is started in a directory that contains an <code>.rvmrc</code> it is vital that RVM be the last thing to prepend elements to the PATH (at least any PATH elements that might contain a <code>ruby</code> (etc.) so that the Ruby installation selected in the <code>.rvmrc</code> will be effective).RVM arranges to source <code>.rvmrc</code> files by “hooking” your shell’s <code>cd</code> command (a <code>cd</code> shell function in bash, an entry in <code>chpwd_functions</code> for zsh). Normally this lets it catch any “normal” <code>cd</code> command that you type it or run via a sourced script after loading RVM.I do not have Lion to test with, but I suspect the way it works is that Terminal forks, calls chdir(2), then execs your shell to establish your new shell’s initial working directory. This means that the directory is already established by the time RVM is loaded in your shell initialization file.The history seems a bit muddy, but RVM has had some support for sourcing the <code>.rvmrc</code> file in the shell’s initial working directory when it is first loaded. It looks like maybe it was intended to be screen-specific, but in RVM <a href=\"https://github.com/wayneeseguin/rvm/commit/cb649baafa9a59e9f62a1d52b018b5c2466f\" rel=\"nofollow\">commit cb649ba (Always load the .rvmrc if in an interactive shell (open new tab in same dir)., 2011-05-14) relaxed the requirement so that it should source <code>.rvmrc</code> files for any interactive shell when RVM is first loaded. This commit was first present in the 1.6.10 release of RVM. The code has changed a bit since then, but it still works in (more or less) the same way in the latest versions.',\n",

       "  'utterances': [{'utterance': \"I'm on my third mid-2011 MacBook Air in less than a month and this weird wifi problem may be related to the sudden, black screen bricklike nature of its predecessors.The Air works fine when in the same large living room as the NexusLink 5631 router, but when I go into adjacent rooms, including, irritatingly, the one where my desk is, it repeatedly loses and regains its wifi signal. (Sites don't load in the browser, it stops being able to play music to the speakers in the living room, it stops being able to find the Time Machine backup drive in the living room, etc.)My several year old MacBook does not have this problem and we haven't changed the router setup. This lost wifi signal problem is purely an issue with the Air.The first two Airs I had suffered catastrophic failures. The pattern I can reconstruct is that at after getting them and using Time Machine to restore them to have all my old files, I had put them on my desk in the other room and put them to sleep in there overnight for the first time. In the morning they would not start, would not even display any error. The folks at the Genius Bar couldn't figure out what was wrong with them (as far as I know could get no response from them at all) and so exchanged them for new machines.When Airs #1 and #2 failed they had been connected to 1) a power supply that was connected to a power strip plugged into an outlet;2) an external Nocent LCD monitor LM965WA with their lids up, displays unmirrored;3) a powered Aquagate Monospace USB 2.0 7 port hub;4) through the hub, a powered down HP Deskjet 920C printer; a powered up Brother HL2140 laser printer; and a Fitbit base station.They had been connected to Time Machine on a Drobo in the other room, adding to the same history as previous machines.Note that all of the above had been used without issue, apart from dropping wifi signal, prior to the overnight machine deaths. Also note that the old MacBook performed great for months and months in this setup.With Air #3, we got a lot more cautious. We started a new sparsebundle to give it its own Time Machine history, on the principle that perhaps a history going back to 2008 was too much for it to handle over the air.I have successfully put Air #3 to sleep overnight in the living room (where the router is) plugged into a new power cable.I have also done so in the other room on my desk, also with new cable, using the same power outlet, but not going through the surge suppressor.Air #3 has the same wifi dropping problem as the prior two Airs, so I'm wondering if this is an issue I'd have with any new machine or if I have received three defective machines.My QA process to see if Air #3 will die overnight like it's pals is going to involve step by step letting it sleep overnight reintroducing one at a time the elements above, postponing the surge suppressor and Fitbit to last in the process.However, it is unclear if the wifi issue is a cause of the failure (hard to see quite how when the machine is asleep and not trying to connect to, say, do an enormous Time Machine backup) or merely a coincidentally occurring problem.Troubleshooting suggestions or pointers to others with either of these problems would be gratefully received!\",\n",

       "  'utterances': [{'utterance': 'My wife scrapbooks our photos, and has recently upgraded from her old computer to a brand new MacBook Pro.  She is a big fan of \"if it ain\\'t broke, don\\'t fix it\", so has been using iPhoto 6 on MacOS 10.4.11 on her old computer.  She now has iPhoto 11 on MacOS 10.6.8.The problem is when she goes to print a photo, the quality is much worse than it used to be.  We are using the same printer (an HP PSC 2175 all-in-one), photo ink, and photo paper as before, and printing the exact same photo, selecting the correct photo paper and \"Best Quality\" in the print settings, and the comparison is laughable.  The overall color is dingy/yellow/darker compared to the old print.I\\'m hoping that there is some setting (or multiple settings) that were introduced or the default value changed inbetween iPhoto 6 and iPhoto 11 that is causing this difference.  Can anyone tell me what I can change to make it print out good photos again?  Or suggest things to try?In the print dialog box, we have already tried changing the \"Color Matching\" preference from \"Vendor Matching\" to \"ColorSync (automatic)\" and that didn\\'t make a noticeable difference.  We looked over the options listed under \"Real Life Digital Photography\", but nothing seemed to jump out at us as a likely fix, and I am reluctant to keep printing out photo ink to try each setting individually.-- Update 8/7/2011 --I have tried printing the same photo on our Epson Stylus NX420.  We only have plain paper for that printer, but when I select the plain paper / best quality setting, the photo is the correct brightness in the lighter areas, but the other colors have a strong blue tint compared to the original and the HP print.I have also printed the same photo on the HP printer from Preview (by dragging the thumbnail to the desktop and then opening that).  That printed out better quality and color matching than the same settings using iPhoto 11 (I tried both plain paper and photo paper, with the appropriate settings), and also had the added benefit of not auto-cropping my 4x6 prints.  However, the pictures were more pixelated than ones printed from iPhoto.  Always something!  :-P  Maybe iPhoto is doing some sort of smoothing filter, and that is why the colors are off?I reconsidered my reinstall iPhoto 6 idea (either uninstalling iPhoto 11 or in addition to it).  I have verified that it should work on Snow Leopard, but I know the iPhoto Library is already modified such that iPhoto 6 will not recognize it.  Perhaps I could just have her import the pictures she wants to print into the iPhoto 6 library in order to print them, that wouldn\\'t be terrible if it worked.',\n",

I can get native vertical with horizontal borders at 1024x768, or I can get close to full screen after scaling with slim borders by using 1680x1050, but neither of these are ideal.Is there any way to set my iMac to use these resolutions when I am connected via Screen Sharing?

The messages from Console.app are as follows (the same 2 happen every launch, in this order):<pre><code>    8/14/11 9:09:07.841 AM [0x0-0x49049].com.blacktree.Quicksilver:    Error:    WirelessAttach: -2013261844    8/14/11 9:09:07.863 AM com.apple.launchd.peruser.501: ([0x0-        0x49049].com.blacktree.Quicksilver[22241]) Exited with code: 255</code></pre>Update: I found the trouble plug-in. It was Airport Module, of all things. Perhaps WirelessAttach was a clue. If any of you are having the same problems, I recommend removing the plugin (~/Library/Application Support/Quicksilver/PlugIns/\",\n",

I believe this component is part of the Xcode 4 executable, rather than standalone. It allows you to preview the merged file, and directly edit merged code on a case-by-case basis, which makes merging complex conflicts incredibly fast and satisfactory.Is there any way to use the Xcode 4 mergetool when invoking 'git mergetool' from the Terminal?I cannot find an executable for this tool inside the Xcode 4 bundle.

Besides, the UI is completely different from Filemerge.Kaleidoscope 2 beta was recently released, and it allows inline editing of merged files. Check it out, it's quite good. The only thing it's missing is a different color for conflicts (it uses the same color as code substitution for those).After some months using Kaleidoscope and despite it being generally good, I have to say that it's still kind of buggy and/or confusing, specially when compared to Xcode 4.x conflict-resolving component.

At that time, I remember to have stumbled upon a blog/article suggesting a few options to activate/deactivate. I cannot find that page again. What are the things to activate/deactivate? PS : for example, I remember desactivating something about spotlight indexation. Thanks, EDIT : (Irrevelant to the question)A little feedback about the SSD experience. Well I bought my MBP about a year ago. I work in IT sector and create a quite a lot websites. I had the \"classic\" hdd before it (250go). After a few months, the disk started to make noise. Clicking and ticking. My Mac being absolutely critical, (without it I can\\'t work) I decided to take no risk and to buy an SSD for two reasons : First of all, it\\'s shock resistance. I have to move around a lot and my MBP follows me everywhere. And thus is shaken from time to time. Secondly beacause of the performance gain. There are a few other reasons but they were not really decisive in my case. Such as noise reduction. Working mostly with a headset noise or not, I won\\'t hear it. Battery is supposed to last longer since SSD are less power consuming. In my case, I haven\\'t seen any changes about it. It is not lasting longer or running out of power earlier than before. No changes about that. Let\\'s say, SSD is a total change. You can buy a new processor three fo four times faster than the one, you had before, double your ram, chagne your motherboard, do whatever yo want. Nothing is going to provide the same performance boost as an SSD. Even now, nearly 8 months later, performance is still present and not impacted by usage. ',\n",

So, I installed smcFanControl at first but then nothing was happening. I created a \"High RPM\" setting and even if I set it to that, fan stays at 2000rpm. When I open a flash app(say an fb game or even Steam) it lurches to 6krpm(not surprising i guess?)Anyway, I tried another fan control(Fan Control) for Mac and now I got this:the right fan is at -1! Is this the reason? I am guessing it is somehow broken and that the left fan was compensating for the longest time, which may or may not have been the culprit to the slow down. Is it?

It is pretty normal that Flash makes your fan spin like crazy. It happens on my machine too, since it is really processor intensive.Secondly, as far as I know Macbooks have just 1 fan, unlike iMacs for example, so if thats the case of your machine (which most likeley is, but jsut to make sure research) than you must not worry for the -1. And finally: nope. Fan speeds should not affect the performance of your machine. I know because when I had problems with mine my macbook would just overheat/make noise but work as usual. The fan even died, and my macbook kept running (though it's dangerous to run a computer without a fan). I didn't notice this happened and it finally overheated to about 90-100 degrees Celsius which caused it to shutdown automatically for safety. My point? I didn't even notice, because my mac never slowed down. So I'm guessing your issues are due to something else. Firevalut could be a reason, and a pretty big one if your disk is very cluttered. Even with Firevalut off, disk clutter can slow down your computer if its excessive, specially on startup.RAM could be, specially if your running memory intensive apps. Your macbook should be able to get an upgrade. Your manual should have some more info on that, like up to what you can expand it (perhaps 4 or 8 GB).What OS do you have? If your'e still running leopard I recomend Snow Leopard: it frees up Disk Space and has some other optimizations.And last, your apps. Check if any apps are eating your CPU in the background using Activity Monitor (Applications/Utilities/Activity Monitor). Also, check on System Preferences for any apps loading when you loggin (Accounts > Login Items tab). Try to get rid of some background apps you might not need. Hope it helps! Anything else you need just tell me.\",\n",

Double-Click the \"uninstall_AU.command\" included in the \"Support  OpenMe/Uninstall Your Software\" folder to remove the installed  plug-ins.  Double-Click the \"backup_licenses.command\" included in the  \"Support OpenMe/Backup Your Licenses\" folder, the Nomad Factory folder  will be renamed to \"Nomad Factory Backup\", Presets and Licenses will  be saved.  When ready, run the installer. This will create a new Nomad  Factory folder including the Licenses and Plug-In Settings folders  with the correct permissions settings. (You can now drag any backed up  licenses/presets from the backup folder directly into the newly  created folders)      The Backup folder can be found here : <code>/Library/Application  Support/Nomad</code> Factory Backup  The new created Nomad Factory folder can be found here :  <code>/Library/Application Support/Nomad Factory</code>        After moving your saved licenses, launch your host application and it  should work. You can now delete the <code>Nomad Factory Backup</code> folder.</blockquote>If that doesn\\'t work try removing this plugin from <code>Macintosh HD/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/Components</code> and then starting Logic. You don\\'t need to delete the file, just grab it and move it some place else like your Desktop. The file should be named something like <code>Macintosh HD/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/Components/BT Analog Chorus CH2S-3.component</code>. As far as Logic is concerned, if there\\'s no <code>.component</code> file in a sub-directory of <code>Macintosh HD/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/Components</code> then the plugin doesn\\'t exist and it doesn\\'t get loaded on boot up of Logic.If removing the file from the <code>Components</code> directory solves the problem then you\\'ve definitely pinpointed the issue. You can try and re-install your Nomad Factory BT Analog Chorus CH2S-3 plugin from the media you got when you purchased it and see if that fixes the problem. If that doesn\\'t help, <a href=\"http://www.nomadfactory.com/support/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">contact Nomad Factory support and let them know about your issues and that you tried their repair procedure already.',\n",

Moreover, it lags not only on Blu-ray movies but movie files ripped from standard definition DVDs and other formats as well.I play all those movies with the power plugged in from downloaded files, not from optical DVDs. Even Stanford University lectures from iTunesU sometimes lag for me.UPDATE: I was in the Genius bar several times, reinstalled Lion by my own and also in the Apple Store.After the fresh install I tried to test videos. I watched House, M.D. season 8 episode 2 (395.9 MB) yesterday, and it started lagging all over again.I do not really know what to do.

Java used to be part of the core OS: it helps not only on running web content, but also some apps and scripts. Having said this, I suppose the reason why it doesn\\'t come pre-installed in lion is because its heavy, and Apple wanted to make the download as light as possible. Nevertheless, I don\\'t expect it to be uninstallable because some of its components get deep into the OS. I suggest you simply turn it off. As you said before it gets the job done, plus you never know when you might need it again; as I mentioned before, even some native apps make use of it. It\\'s there. It\\'s sleeping. It isn\\'t hurting anyone... I think its the best option.Hope it helps. ',\n",

If it outputs only DVI, you\\'re in trouble, as you\\'ll need another converter that converts this digital signal to a VGA one.Alternatively you could get a USB graphics card that outputs TV signals directly, although I can\\'t seem to find one right now. This would be act like an additional monitor, which may be preferable.In case your TV has SCART inputs (Europe mostly) instead of composite/S-video, you\\'ll also need a <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Switchable-S-Video-Adaptor-Cable-Mountain/dp/B0018DE4ZU/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">SCART adapter, although this may be included with some of the products mentioned above.The whole setup would look like this:<pre><code>Mac -&gt; Mini DisplayPort to VGA adapter -&gt; Converter box -&gt; [SCART adapter] -&gt; TV</code></pre>',\n",

When you are logged in (as user <code>harith</code>), then the unecrypted contents of that same directory are visible under <code>/Users/harith</code>, that is, your home directory.So what you\\'re seeing is, your hard disk is full. And your home directory is taking up 178 GiB of space.IT IS NOT SAFE TO DELETE <code>/Users/.harith/harith.sparsebundle</code>!!!!! This is your home directory\\'s files, and deleting this will delete or corrupt your home directory!!!What you will want to do is look for large files within your home directory, and move those to an external drive. As @lemonginger mentioned, movies and music are good places to look, but not so they\\'re not being decrypted as he said, that\\'s irrelevant. And don\\'t just move them anywhere, you need to move them to a different hard drive otherwise you won\\'t solve the problem.If you don\\'t have a second hard drive, consider moving files to a cloud-based storage system, such as <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/icloud/\">Apple\\'s iCloud service or <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/clouddrive/learnmore\">Amazon\\'s Cloud Drive. This can be either a permanent solution, or a temporary storage space until you can expand your local disk storage. Amazon may be a good choice because they offer 5 GB at no cost, and I believe you can get up to 20GB free if you purchase any MP3 from them.In order to reduce the size of your home directory\\'s encrypted sparsebundle, you need to log out. After you log out, if you have deleted files from within your FileVault home directory, you will see a dialog appear with a progress indicator which states \"Reclaiming unused space in  home directory\". What this is actually doing is removing the parts of <code>/Users/.harith/harith.sparsebundle</code> which are no longer in use (because you have deleted files).A side note: <code>/Users/.harith/harith.sparsebundle</code> is only when you are logged in. When you log out, <code>/Users/.harith/harith.sparsebundle</code> is moved to <code>/Users/harith/harith.sparsebundle</code>, and it\\'s moved back when you next log in.',\n",

Instead, specific applications can provide a custom keyboard or another way to easily input emoticons.So what replacements for the SMS app do provide shortcuts to input ASCII emoticons? For use by people unfamiliar by all those weird punctuations.I am looking for something similar to the <a href=\"http://www.tech-recipes.com/rx/5635/android-how-to-access-common-emoticons-from-the-messaging-sms-keyboard/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Messaging keyboard on Android.

I\\'d hate to lose my keychain passwords.Update:I also tried dragging my login.keychain file from Finder into Keychain Access, and had no luck.  I tried some digging around in the security command line app as well, but have made no progress...Update 2:After trying all the suggestions I commented on here I was still getting this error, but then I did a software update, and rebooted, and now my keychain is working again.

You can of course get breakout boxes like the Griffin iMic and have the benefit of a cleaner D/A circuit at the expense of carrying another device that\\'s plugged into USB. Just like everything - some of the expensive products are over priced and some of the cheap ones are worthless. I\\'d go with a name brand - especially if their products are carried on the Apple Online or stocked in the retail stores.Lion does add a control where you can select the speaker icon in the menu and switch from input and output.As to the rationale - unless an engineer from Apple steps up, we\\'ll have to speculate.Here are the reasons to have fewer ports. (They\\'re not al good, but they are reasons)Simplicity - the iPhone / iPad / iPod touch all have one port. Many people don\\'t need or want the confusion of knowing which port they plugged in to their mac. Just as you really appreciate having two, many appreciate having only one stereo jack.Internal simplicity - one less switch, one less moving part, several solder points.Internal spacing is far more important than external space. If you look at <a href=\"http://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Installing-MacBook-Pro-13-Inch-Unibody-Early-2011-Logic-Board-Replacement/5154/1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">iFixit\\'s excellent take apart manual - you will see there actually isn\\'t room on the logic board for another connector. The design would have to sacrifice an USB port or the SD card slot to make room for a second package without reducing the space for the battery. These macs are packed incredibly tightly and despite the clean appearance of excess external space, inside they are packed like proverbial sardines in a can.This lack of space likely cuts features from the smaller macs like a redundant mini headphone port.',\n",

Background I made the mistake of pairing the Magic trackpad via System->Bluetooth->Bluetooth Setup Assistant.  By doing this the only thing I can use the trackpad for is pointing an left clicking.  I now see that it can be paired via the System->Trackpad->Set Up Bluetooth Trackpad... option.What I have tried  Inside Bluetooth settings: Disconnected the device, then using the <code>-</code> button removed it.  Then powered down the trackpad and restarted the pairing process by holding the power button.  While the green led is flashing, I go to the Trackpad set up and find the device.  However it keeps failing when connecting to the trackpad.  I did notice that it fails immediately  after seeing the \"Connected\" message displayed on my screen.  At this point I can use the trackpad as a pointing device, but am unable to connect to it using the trackpad set up.

I\\'m unsure of any other specific term for this, but <a href=\"http://www.niconico.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nico Nico has a link in their streaming interface to download an XML file containing stream quality parameters, default device selection, and of course the URL of the streaming server.

And these days an iPhone battery really seemed \"unkillable\". It was really hard to drain about 50% with wifi and 3g internet, games, photos and videos, music, and several different apps.But now I experience something strange: my battery drops 30% by night (just locked screen), and when I use my iPhone not so hard as first days (just music and Safari), battery has only 30% remaining (out of 100%) in 5 hrs.Well, it\\'s very bad. I don\\'t want to charge my iPhone twice a day.Also, when I leave my iPhone charging for night (I know it can fully charge in 1 hr), I see 93% in the morning. And it doesn\\'t increase.So, as I said I calibrated my battery several times when got an iPhone, and now battery drains super-fast. Can anybody tell me what\\'s wrong and what should I do to make my battery work as expected (at least 10-15 hrs on hard usage, but 20+ hrs will be welcome :D)?Hope to hear the solution.

       "   {'utterance': '<a href=\"http://www.emmgunn.com/mp4tools/mp4toolshome.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">MP4Tools works for this. It does pass-thru of h.264 and audio streams, or you can convert as you see fit. It\\'s free, but $5 to remove the nag screen that pops up any time you open a file, and to get batch operations. I haven\\'t tested it with chapters and subs, but I think it can deal with them fine. One word of caution: if you have files with AC3 audio that you want to leave in as a 2nd channel, it has an option to do pass-thru of that, and add a stereo AAC track, but it doesn\\'t re-order them, which can cause issues with QuickTime X/iPad/AppleTV.MP4Tools doesn\\'t work for anything below 10.6, so <a href=\"http://www.emmgunn.com/oldsoftware.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">MKVtools is a good alternative for 10.5. Same developer and basic functionality, it should work for your purposes fine.The other option is doing it manually using command line tools, <a href=\"http://www.bunkus.org/videotools/mkvtoolnix/\" rel=\"nofollow\">mkvtoolnix to extract the streams from the mkv, and <a href=\"http://gpac.wp.institut-telecom.fr/mp4box/\" rel=\"nofollow\">MP4Box to repackage in an MP4. If you need to convert audio to AAC, <a href=\"http://ffmpeg.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">ffmpeg is the a good starting point, but there are other options. Unless you need a degree of control that MP4Tools doesn\\'t provide, I\\'d say stay away from the command line stuff. It\\'s useful, but more hassle than it\\'s worth if MP4Tools does what you need.Another good tool is <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/subler/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Subler, which is a nice tagging program. Unfortunately lacking a batch mode, but it\\'s otherwise very good - much faster at writing the tags than other programs I\\'ve tried. And as long as the files have season &amp; episode numbers, the tag auto-lookup works great.',\n",

After <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/iterm2/source/checkout\" rel=\"nofollow\">reviewing the source code, I found in iTerm2 v1.0.0.20111020 is hard-coded to open a new session as a tab if a session already exists, when it receives nearly any \"launch this URL with a handler\" command.My Xcode and Objective-C skills are still rather weak, but if you want to give it a shot I believe the problem is related to the source file iTermController.m. On lines 789 to 870 the <code>launchBookmark:withURL</code> method has the following code:<pre><code>// Where do we execute this command?BOOL toggle = NO;if (theTerm == nil) {    [iTermController switchToSpaceInBookmark:aDict];    term = [[[PseudoTerminal alloc] initWithSmartLayout:YES                                             windowType:[aDict objectForKey:KEY_WINDOW_TYPE] ?

Perhaps you can modify the code to force the first block to always run, regardless of <code>theTerm</code>\\'s contents.I hope this helps!! ..

This works well, and is my current system.But I miss Mac OSX ... a little.  More so now that I have an iPad and don't want to have to use Windows to sync stuff with it.

However, I am having trouble identifying the chipset in the MacBook. The computer is listed as being a May, 2007 white MacBook with a 2.4Ghz Intel Core 2 Duo processor.I found a FAQ online which states states that there are two Intel chipsets which this MacBook could have, the Calistoga chipset which supports up to 3.3Gb of RAM or the Crestline which supports up to 4Gb (maybe 6Gb). Then it states that, \"To find out which C2D MacBook you have you can check the FSB clock or the GPU: If you have a 667 MHz FSB and a GMA 950 you have a Calistoga C2D MB. If you have a 800 MHz FSB and a GMA X3100 you have a Crestline C2D MacBook.\"However, the specs listed for the computer do not match either of these descriptions. For the GPU, it states \"VideoGraphic Processor:  Intel Graphics Media Accelerator (GMA) X3100Installed Video Memory: 64 MB,\" which would imply that it uses the Crestline chipset and can support 4Gb RAM. However, for the mobo FSB it states \"Motherboard Bus Speed:   667 MHz,\" which would imply that it is a Calistoga board which only supports 3.3Gb of RAM. I attempted to look up the exact computer to see the specs on everymac.com, but I was unable to find the correct model. Every listing for a white 2007 MacBook on that website said it had the GMA950 GPU, not the X3100. Additionally, the computer for sale says it has a 2.4Ghz Intel Core 2 Duo processor (there is a picture of the \"About this Mac\" window) and that isn\\'t listed as an available option for any 2007 MacBook.  (Since the specs are automatically generated based on the date the seller enters, perhaps it is not actually a May 2007 MacBook? I don\\'t know if macs are overclockable but it is definitely running at 2.4Ghz)The RAM is definitely 667Mhz DDR2, as that is listed in the same picture from the actual computer screen as the processor speed. The hard drive was upgraded by the user and thus cannot be used for identification purposes. The computer is running Lion. Can anyone provide any assistance in identifying which chipset is in this MacBook?To clarify: If the specs generated based on the May 2007 date are wrong, the only specs I know for certain are that it has a 2.4Ghz Intel Core 2 Duo processor and it currently has 2 GB 667Mhz DDR2 SDRAM, because these are shown in the screenshot. However, the seller says he upgraded the RAM himself, and that it initially came with only 1Gb of RAM.',\n",

This event has a reminder set to execute the workflow 0 minutes before the event.To execute it every day on 4 a.m., just schedule the event that way (you could also set it to only repeat on weekdays – or to anything iCal will let you do with a scheduled event). To make sure the triggering event itself is not included, make sure the “Filter iCal Calendar” action (the 1st step of your workflow) excludes the “Automator” calendar – either because filter conditions will bypass it anyway, or by setting a filter condition to “Name is not Automator”.You can hide the “Automator” calendar from displaying in iCal by unchecking its checkbox in iCal’s calendar list, thus making your workflow execute invisibly for all practical purposes. Also note iCal does not need to run for the event to be triggered, but you must be logged in and the computer should not be sleeping (a workaround for that last gotcha is to <a href=\"https://discussions.apple.com/thread/2459295?start=0&amp;tstart=0\" rel=\"nofollow\">set the machine to wake up shortly before the scheduled time in Power Saving System Settings – this would also be necessary if you scheduled with <code>launchd</code> or <code>cron</code>).

I'd like to be able to do the season path math, but I do not know how to determine how many episodes for a season. A typical network season airs 23 episodes for a given show. So The Good Wife in HD, for example, costs 52.99 for Season 3. If 23 shows are delivered the cost is 2.30 per episode a discount of .69 per episode, or a savings of 15.78 on the season. But what if it is cancelled after only 10 episodes? Did I just pay 5.30 per episode? Will I get a refund?I know this situation is unlikely on a show like The Good Wife, but it possible on this show and even likely on some new shows.

The advantage is that you can set it and forget it, and it will back up all your files (with options for some things you might want to exclude).Another option is using Dropbox. You can move your iPhoto Library from your Pictures folder to the Dropbox folder and alias it to the original location (drag using ⌘option to make an alias instead of a copy). If you don\\'t alias it, iPhoto should just ask you where the library is stored when you relaunch it anyway.I don\\'t really think of services like Flickr as backup, they\\'re more of an online photo organizer, but yes they can be used that way too.

For reasons unknown, the designers of TextEdit opted for <a href=\"http://hintsforums.macworld.com/showthread.php?t=60986\" rel=\"nofollow\">storing favorite styles in the global preferences file (<code>~/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist</code>) when they introduced the feature. They might have intended to create a user global stored styles system for <a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/TextUILayer/TextUILayer.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">NSText based rich text editors (not the only oddity of the system – <a href=\"http://pagesfaq.blogspot.com/2008/05/textedit-and-styles.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">this post has a good write-up of TextEdit’s style implementation). This has worked up to and including OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard.In OS X 10.7 Lion however, TextEdit has been <a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Miscellaneous/Reference/EntitlementKeyReference/EnablingAppSandbox/EnablingAppSandbox.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40011195-CH4-SW1\" rel=\"nofollow\">sandboxed (sandboxing means, in layman’s terms: the operating system only grants an application discrete rights to access the file system, network, OS services etc. as defined by the app – so called entitlements. Anything a sandboxed application tries beyond that what is covered by its entitlements will be denied and logged by the sandbox daemon <code>sandbox</code>). A look at the log, where you will find an entry similar to this one<pre><code>02.11.11 14:44:54,659 sandboxd: ([73342]) TextEdit(73342) deny file-write-create /Users/&lt;user&gt;/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist.c2n4nCb</code></pre>each time you try to store a new favorite style shows that writing to <code>.GlobalPreferences</code> is not among TextEdit’s entitlements. The result: Lion’s TextEdit can neither store new favorite styles*, nor delete ones written ether by previous versions of TextEdit (your case).To get rid of the old styles, you need to remove the <code>NSFavoriteStyles</code> key from the global preferences list. If you have Xcode installed, invoking<pre><code>open ~/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist</code></pre>will open the file in Xcode’s plist Editor, where you can remove / modify it manually. If you don’t,<pre><code>defaults delete -g NSFavoriteStyles</code></pre>will get rid of all stored (“favorite”) styles.* it might look like it does, as these are stored in memory while TextEdit runs, and with Lion’s revamped process management, it is difficult to tell when textEdit really quits. Still, once it does, the favorite styles disappear.ADDENDUM: Reported as a bug to Apple (OpenRadar <a href=\"http://openradar.appspot.com/radar?id=1421401\" rel=\"nofollow\">rdar://10385163).<br>According to Apple Developer Relations, this bug has been quashed as of OS X 10.8',\n",

But this is an amazing software.BUT it has awesome interface and if I have to teach my grandmother, this is the perfect software - simple, all the complexity is hidden. Saves diskspace, I like it a lot. Thanks for the link**tribler** - the best feature if this torrent client is the tor-like network it's using to hide its identity. On OSX it's not working as far as I checked. In terms of streaming - it's opening a local stream channel that I couldn't make work, but it's important to ask why is it doing so. Can't I just play the contents? Tribler is very cpu-intensive as far as I checked. But it will get better i suppose and the anonymity feature is awesome. Again thanks for the link.**tribler** - update: it's tor-like anonymity thingy works as expected on OS X. Pretty awesome.**tribler** - the streaming feature works. But for the god of me I can't understand the reasoning - it's streaming a locally downloading file to you (locally). Probably because it doesn't trust your player can play it? Windows Media Player maybe?\",\n",

You can get yourself badly burned at 80 deg, so why would this be good for a computer part, especially over 2 or 3 years? :-/I remember I had a problem with a Mac Pro years ago. All the RAM slots were occupied, and iStat reported 70+ temperatures in these slots, even though the fans were doing their job. But I had a lot of crashes and kernel panics. Then I thought that such temperatures could not be helping. Then I installed a little helper app that enables you to set the minimum speed for any fan in you system. I just set the fans to 1200 rpms instead of the default 800, and everything began behaving smoothly from that point. Putting my hand to the back of the computer I could really feel the difference in temperature. And the modules' temperature went from 70-80 C to 35-45 C in about 5-10 minutes!!Of course the fan noises was slightly more annoying, but I was willing to sacrifice a bit of my sanity for a stable computer. :-)The app was named smcFanControl (http://www.eidac.de/). Works with Lion as of v 2.3. And free. There are of course other apps that would do the same, but this one has worked flawlessly for many years.I think that Apple is setting it's temperature threshold limits a little too low, all for the sake of silence of operation...\",\n",

And if it's a still-unsolved problem, is there any work-around I can use to bring the screen back to life without rebooting the laptop?Technical details, as copied from the About This Mac dialog:<pre><code>MacBook Pro15-inch, Late 2011Processor  2.2 GHz Intel Core i7Memory  8 GB 1333 MHz DDR3Graphics  AMD Radeon HD 6750M 512 MBSoftware  Mac OS X Lion 10.7.2 (11C74)</code></pre>Running software update reports that the laptop is up-to-date.I only got it yesterday, and have managed to install a grand total of just 4 applications (Keka, Steam, Syncplicity and Chrome).I have no peripherals connected - the only physical connection is the power cord, the only wireless connection is the Wi-Fi. The problem persists whether the mac is connected to the power or not.The problem is consistent, once the screen turns off it's always doomed.\",\n",

You need plugins because files can be binary data – without knowledge of its structure, no representation of the file is possible – or textual data that needs processing – HTML for instance, which you’ll probably prefer to preview rendered, not as raw source. They also must be limited to specific, known file types (to be precise: <a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/FileManagement/Conceptual/understanding_utis/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Uniform Type Identifiers, or UTIs for short) for this exact reason – a rendering plugin for HTML will not give you a usable preview for a JPEG. OS X provides quite an impressive default collection of these plugins (located in <code>/System/Library/QuickLook</code>), and applications you install add their own (located in the application package itself, <code>/Library/QuickLook</code> or <code>~/Library/QuickLook</code>). You can also add some yourself to those two last locations.In the case of text files without an extension, the problem is OS X’s built-in plain-text QuickLook plugin is not assigned to these as they do not correspond to a UTI it handles. However, there is a 3rd party QuickLook plugin adding that functionality: <a href=\"http://whomwah.github.com/qlstephen/\" rel=\"nofollow\">QLStephen. Just download it and install it according to its installation instructions <a href=\"https://github.com/whomwah/qlstephen#readme\" rel=\"nofollow\">on GitHub and you should be good to go.',\n",

They look like this:<pre><code># VirtualHost example:# Almost any Apache directive may go into a VirtualHost container.# The first VirtualHost section is used for all requests that do not# match a ServerName or ServerAlias in any &lt;VirtualHost&gt; block.#&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;    ServerAdmin webmaster@dummy-host.example.com    DocumentRoot \"/usr/docs/dummy-host.example.com\"    ServerName dummy-host.example.com    ServerAlias www.dummy-host.example.com    ErrorLog \"/private/var/log/apache2/dummy-host.example.com-error_log\"    CustomLog \"/private/var/log/apache2/dummy-host.example.com-access_log\" common&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;</code></pre>Add <code>#</code> signs to the beginning of those lines to comment them out.An alternative to this is to use an app like <a href=\"http://clickontyler.com/virtualhostx/\" rel=\"nofollow\">VirtualHostX to do this for you ($35).Edit 5 Dec 2011:Here\\'s a new blog post by the makers of <a href=\"http://alfredapp.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Alfred on how they set this up:<a href=\"http://preppeller.com/2011/12/04/setting-up-virtual-hosts-on-your-local-os-x-apache/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://preppeller.com/2011/12/04/setting-up-virtual-hosts-on-your-local-os-x-apache/',\n",

Since Addressbook and iCal have my current information, any non-iPhone device with access to Google calendar and contacts could use what I have on my Macs.  The non-iPhone device will need to be capable of syncing with Google calendar and contacts and most apps today have that functionality.  I also have a Comcast account that meshes fine with this setup since mail.app uses Addressbook and iCal instead of Comcast's contacts and calendar.  I sync everything by using the sync icon in the menu bar several times a week.

To make Adium go online the Applescript code is:<pre><code>tell application \"Adium\" to go online</code></pre>To make it go invisible, the Applescript code is:<pre><code>tell application \"Adium\" to go invisible</code></pre>Pretty simple. You can also tell Adium to <code>go away</code>. Open the Applescript Editor App in your /Applications/Utilities directory and create two Applescript files; one has just the command to go online and the other the command to go invisible/away. Save them as .scpt files with appropriate names.That was the easy part. The next question is how do you trigger the right script at the right time? You essentially need to create the following two scheduled tasks:\"run adium_invisible.scpt at 5pm everyday\"\"run adium_online.scpt at 8am everyday\"The default way to do this, built into OS X, is to use the UNIX \\'cron\\' daemon. It\\'s documentation can be found <a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Darwin/Reference/Manpages/man5/crontab.5.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">here. If you find the cron interface intimidating, there is a GUI app you can use to set tasks up, called <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/cronnix/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cronnix. You\\'ll still need to understand the timing syntax that crontab files use though. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia can get you up speed on that. Inside your user crontab you want to create two scheduled tasks. They should look like this:<pre><code>0 8 * * * osascript path/to/adium_online.scpt</code></pre>and<pre><code>0 17 * * * osascript path/to/adium_invisible.scpt</code></pre><code>osascript</code> is an Apple specific command that lets the shell call and run an Applescript. You give it the path to the .scpt file as a paramater. Once you have the two cron tasks set up you should be good to go.If editing the crontab file by hand, and not using Cronnix, don\\'t copy and paste these verbatim, as tabs are required between the hours, minutes, days etc., not spaces as I have here.Also, you could create cron tasks that use osascript and pass the Applescript directly like this:<pre><code>osascript -e \\'tell application \"Adium\" to go online\\'</code></pre>However, storing the Applescript commands in a separate file gives you flexibility in the likely event that you need to change what commands get run later on. You can add to or remove from the .scpt files without needing to interfere with the crontab file.',\n",

So the music and apps were gone! I look in the itunes library and the music is all gone too.These apps and music were not purchased content (AFAIK). In particular i think the apps were free ones (little games), but all these apps will need to be re-downloaded. Plus save game files may be gone.I do not know if the device was jail broken or anything. I am not an Apple Pro.What went wrong?AdditionalI also tried to do a restore and there was a drop down list.

So I think the update wasn't installed properly.Here are some problems that it caused.Whenever I plug a thumb drive or external HDD it's not being mounted. But I can see the drive in Disk Utility. The USB port i think is working because I use it for my wireless mouse. - my guess is the drive for external drives got corrupted.When I try calling someone on Skype it logs me out.There are some lags with the animation. e.g. when i run the Launchpad it has a laggy and harsh animation. It's feels like the animation only has 3 frames so it isn't that smooth.It's really slow!I just bought this laptop last week and It didn't come with a Mac OS X CD. Is this normal not having a CD?Some solution I'm planning to do:Reformat/Reset my Mac OS X-problem, I don't have the CDRepair the driver-problem, I don't know if it's really the driver fault or which driver I should installPlease advice what should I do.

More general or detailed answers are always welcome, but I'll choose the best answer that covers iOS5 and:Is personally identifiable or data associated with my unique device / serial number collected?Does this collected data sync to my computer to iCloud?Is some or all of the data transmitted over the air or WiFi directly to anyone other than Apple?Since there are many variables, please try to provide the carrier you have, the phone model as well as whether you opted in to send this diagnostic data.

I recently tried to play an Album and an error message came up that said that this computer was not authorized to play the songs and that I would need to access my account to authorize the new computer.  When I clicked through the authorization screen, my original email address came up and asked for my password.  I tried several of my “usual” passwords, but none of them worked.  I clicked on the “forgot my password” link and Apple gave me the option of answering a few security questions or having my password sent to my email address.  Recognizing that I could not access the dead email account, I asked to answer the security questions.  The first one that came up was to enter my birthdate.  I did so and Apple said that my answer was incorrect.  I next tried the street I grew up on and that did not work either.   I soon figured out that none of the questions matched my personal information so I am wondering if these questions were ever associated with my original iTunes account. Apple then locked my account for incorrectly answering the questions.When I called Apple to see if we could do something to unlock the account and tie it to my new account (which would have the same name, address, and other personal information), I was informed that Apple cannot unlock the account and that I had to have access to the old email account to access the account and authorize this new computer to play the music.  After going up three levels of Apple customer service, I was told that there was absolutely nothing they could do for me.  So, I have purchased hundreds of songs that I cannot play now.Is there a work around to this problem?  The songs are stored on my computer – I just can’t play them.',\n",

Google isn\\'t finding anything for me though.As an aside, you should never buy DRM protected content in the first palce because : (a) Eventually you\\'ll lose access one way or another, often by the company discontinuing the service. (b) Your supporting the DRM technologies which create these problems.  Any books, movies, or music distributed with DRM are also available without DRM if you look.',\n",

Furthermore, additional NSS modules can be compiled and linked to, allowing developers to provide different ways to lookup hosts, users, etc.I\\'m trying to find the equivalent subsystem in OS X, but it seems to be something that has changed frequently over the years. Apparently an old system called NetInfo was used since the NeXtStep days, but that hasn\\'t been around since 10.4. This was apparently superseded by something called lookupd, but I don\\'t think it\\'s present in Lion anymore either, since there\\'s no lookupd process running on my system, and <code>man lookupd</code> redirects to <code>dscacheutil</code>.What is the current system Lion uses to delegate these kinds of lookups? Does Apple provide any documentation for writing new plugins for whatever this subsystem is, to allow for different backends to provide these services?Another way to think of this question is: Which subsystem in OSX is responsible for reading <code>/etc/hosts</code> and resolving lookups based on its contents?',\n",

Warning: Apple uses this term to refer to all of the various parts of their directory service architecture, so if you google \"Open Directory\" you\\'ll find both Apple\\'s LDAP-based directory server, and the daemon that runs on OS X and does the function you\\'re looking for.Let me try to give you a historical overview of its development (and hopefully I\\'ll remember which changes happened in which version):NextSTEP (the OS that OS X was based on) had a daemon called lookupd that was, as I understand it, very similar to NSS.  Most of the actual data was stored in NetInfo databases (which could be either local on the computer, or accessed over the net from a server).Early versions of OS X added another deamon, named DirectoryService, which did similar things (but a little differently); since it didn\\'t do everything lookupd did, any query it couldn\\'t find an answer to would get handed off to lookupd.  Result: a certain amount of redundancy and confusion.  IIRC, there were actually some queries that got directed to lookupd first, and them it might have to hand them off to DirectoryService.  There were also two different sets of plug-ins (equiv to NSS modules): those for DirectoryService and those for lookupd. Local users &amp; groups were still stored in NetInfo, but it was deprecated for network accounts in favor of LDAP.I don\\'t remember the details anymore, but over the versions responsibilities gradually got shifted from lookupd to DirectoryService.In 10.5, NetInfo was removed; local users, groups, etc were stored in XML property list files under /var/db/dslocal/.  The plug-in (excuse me, they\\'re called \"connectors\" now) to access them has the not-at-all-generic name \"Local\" (it\\'s sometimes referred to as \"dslocal\" to disambiguate it a bit).  At this point, the only thing lookupd is still responsible for is DNS lookups (although it hands off multicast lookups to mDNSResponder).In 10.6, lookupd was removed; mDNSResponder now handles all DNS lookups, both standard (unicast) and multicast.In 10.7, the Open Directory daemon was renamed from DirectoryService to opendirectoryd.',\n",

The reasons for this should be obvious.When you send email, you connect to a SMTP server and give your username and password. if that username is \"you@gmail.com\" and the \"From:\" line is \"you@owndomain.com\" then Gmail will automatically add the \"Sender:\" header which contains your actual Gmail address. (Outlook displays this as \"via\" I believe.)The only way to avoid that is to have the username that you log in with be \"you@owndomain.com\" rather than \"you@gmail.com\".The easiest way to do that is to use <a href=\"http://www.google.com/a/cpanel/domain/new\" rel=\"nofollow\">Google Apps for your domain which is free for up to 10 users.You can still set that up as a \"Gmail\" account in iOS, but when you send email it will not have the Sender: header added because you are sending from the same account that you use to log in.The only drawback is that you will have two accounts now in the iOS Mail app, which is (I assume) what you wanted to avoid by using the comma trick in the first place. You\\'ll have to decide which is more important: having one email account in iOS (and having \"via\"/Sender: header added), or not having Sender: added and having more than one email account.)',\n",

       "  'utterances': [{'utterance': 'After installing the jailbreak app \"Winterboard\" just now and then rebooting as required, all my apps including settings and phone etc. only display in top left quarter of screen. Only that screen quarter accepts touch input, but the touches are relative to the entire screen. This means I can\\'t interact with the bottom and right halves of any apps, making it impossible to revert the installation.Googling for this problem tells me that it was a problem with the version <code>iOS 5 GM</code>, which is a pre-release. But I\\'m not using that; I\\'ve just installed the newly released iOS 5.0.1. Also, the recommended fix is to use SBSettings to start in failsafe mode, but I never had SBSettings installed, and I can\\'t install it now with the screen acting up this way. How can I fix this problem, apart from restoring from my PC?I know I can restore from backup and then re-do all the jailbreaking, but it\\'d be nice if there was a way to avoid that.This is what I\\'ve done:  I first made a backup to my PC, then the iOS 5.0.1 upgrade, then a restore from the PC to make sure I had all the apps and data again (I didn\\'t; somehow several apps were missing after the restore, but I just installed the rest manually). After that, I did the jailbreak and started adding Cydia apps. One app required the installation of Winterboard, and that is what caused this problem. I\\'m fairly sure Winterboard is the culprit because when it happened, I restored again, jailbroke again, and began reinstalling Cydia apps again in a different order. It broke like this again while installing a different Cydia app that also requires Winterboard.There\\'s a weird effect going on that indicates that although the size of the displayed image is reduced but the size of the touch area remains full-sized but unresponsive outside the displayed quarter of the screen. In a paint app, I can drag from inside the display quarter into outside, but I cannot start a touch outside the display quarter; nothing happens.So I know that I can \"fix\" the problem by restoring from the PC again and avoiding any Cydia apps that require Winterboard. But I would like to avoid restoring if possible, to save myself the trouble. I\\'ll keep that as a last option in case there\\'s no other way to revert this. ',\n",

       "  'utterances': [{'utterance': 'Oh dear, not having much luck at the moment. Having recently <a href=\"https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/35361/some-application-screens-wont-redraw-in-mbp\">wasted hours on a simple problem, I\\'ve transferred my anti-Midas magic to a friend, and lost some email data. Could someone advice (a) whether the below was an obviously stupid idea, and (b) if I can do anything in the way of recovery?So, my friend uses Hotmail via POP3 in Mail, in Mac Lion on a MBP. This is set to delete mail in a week after it is read from the server (although she trims mail manually in the Hotmail web interface, and is fairly sure old mail wasn\\'t being deleted, since she still has very old mail in her web-based inbox).OK, so she\\'s started a new company, and has purchased a domain/hosting package, and needed assistance setting it up. The requirement was that mail should pool in her Mail inbox together with Hotmail, but she should have a profile widget in the New Mail interface that lets her set which email address each message should come from.Easy enough, I reasoned. The domain was already set to forward to her Hotmail address, so the hosting company is not doing any mail holding - just sending it on. I figured that creating a new mail profile which had all her Hotmail credentials except for the From address, which would be the info@example.com address we were setting up, would do the trick. Now, at this stage you\\'re thinking:that\\'s worth a go,that won\\'t work, ordon\\'t do that, you\\'ll break it!I\\'m hoping you\\'re not thinking 3, since I went ahead and did that, and although the profile created, it caused an error, and did not appear to work. The error was:<pre><code>The account path /Users/&lt;name&gt;/Library/Mail/V2/POP-&lt;email&gt;@&lt;pop3-server&gt;is already being used by the account \"Hotmail\".</code></pre>\"OK\", said I - and duly deleted the newly created \"MyDomain\" account. Sadly this removed the inbox, drafts and sent items related to the (perfectly functional) \"Hotmail\" account (which I didn\\'t touch). A call to Apple support in India resulted in the specialist logging a call - and he seemed amenable to the idea that, since the profile popped up that error when we saved it, it should have warned us that it was about to do something catastrophic. I offered to log a bug with Apple via the web, but he said there would be no need, since he\\'d already done it.So, either I hit against a Mail bug, and I should be hopping up and down, or I did something perfectly stupid, and I should be sitting in the naughty corner for a few hours. Honest thoughts very welcome on this point.Meanwhile, my friend and I - in the absence of backups - are trying data recovery software (Disk Drill) to get back the mails that have been lost. We will see if this works tomorrow, but if any other ideas are forthcoming, I am all ears. We\\'ve dug into the Hotmail mail folder, and the important-sounding folders are 40KB or so - i.e. basically empty.Help! and TIA.Edit: it\\'s a long shot, but my friend might have been running iCloud. Should this back up all her email, or just me.com email? We went into the interface and couldn\\'t see anything under email (everything seemed empty) but I guess that might be because she wasn\\'t logged in, or iCloud doesn\\'t back this stuff up, or it wasn\\'t running...',\n",

       "   {'utterance': 'Why the mail was lostMail.app saves data for each email account, indeed, in the following folder structure:<pre><code>~/Library/Mail/V2/POP-&lt;email&gt;@&lt;pop3-server&gt;</code></pre>One folder for each unique mailbox.So, of course, if two emails actually use the exact same <code>&lt;email&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;pop3-server&gt;</code>, you can see that there will be a conflict: both their data would be stored in the same folder, which would conflict on each and every mail / state save.Mail.app warned you about this (though in a very user-unfriendly way. It should have said you can\\'t have two accounts with the exact same username and server). However, where it seems to have bugged quite severly, is that it did create the account in its registry, even though it said it couldn\\'t. So, when you deleted it from the registry, it also went on to delete the data associated with the account. This data was in… well, <code>~/Library/Mail/V2/POP-&lt;email&gt;@&lt;pop3-server&gt;</code>. So, it deleted the data for both accounts, effectively falling into the conflict it had tried to avoid.The “duplication” ideaYou\\'re asking if duplicating the account was a “good / let\\'s try / oh-no” idea. I\\'d say, it\\'s neither. It\\'s just a “won\\'t work &amp; not really useful” idea. If the hosting (publicly-visible) email was set to redirect to hotmail, then all the mail that was needed to check was in hotmail.<pre><code>Sender → email@company → hotmail → Mail.app         ↑ not saved     ↑ not saved         upon transfer   upon POP dl</code></pre>Why create another account with From changing? To be able to send mails that would only show the publicly-visible <code>@company</code> email? Then you did it wrong. Not wrong as in “you\\'ll break it”, but wrong as in “you didn\\'t know how mail works and made a wrong assumption”.Mails are sent using the SMTP protocol (a protocol to send, like POP is a protocol to download mail from a server). Changing the From header would not have been a guarantee that everything would have worked as expected. Indeed, hotmail would have probably (I can\\'t be sure because I don\\'t have any hotmail account, but in my experience most providers do, especially web-based ones) refused to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email#Header_fields\" rel=\"nofollow\">send that mail.Think about it: you would have asked hotmail\\'s SMTP servers to send a mail pretending to come from an address that is not from hotmail. It\\'s like asking UPS to deliver a package that has a competitor\\'s stamp. The main reason this is extremely rare is that it would allow spammers to use such a service to deliver millions of emails without being caught: the mail pretends to originate from @whatever, but is actually sent from @hotmail. How could anyone trace this?Whose responsibility it wasSo, since you seem to be wanting mostly to assign blame:Mail should have been more explicit in its error message; that\\'s not a bug, but that\\'s bad UX.Mail should not have let you validate the account creation upon error. That was a bug, which became critical upon the edge case that you fell in: having another account with the exact same settings, and wanting to delete one of them.The idea of duplicating the account was not a good one, but should never have had such consequences. The assumption you made was false, but there is no doubt it is entirely the software\\'s fault if data loss occurred.As a matter of fact, data loss would not have happened if Mail.app had used a different file hierarchy (not to say it should have, it is much better this way than with useless ID numbers; but I mean it is the implementation that was chosen that is responsible, not the mail setup). They should have seen the edge case of multiple accounts being set up and either completely forbidden multiple accounts creation or not deleted data as long as one account uses the said folder.NextBUY AN EXTERNAL HARD DRIVE AND SET TIME MACHINE UP. We all learn about this the hard way, and it is one such occasion.Forget about hotmail. Seriously. It is a shame to use <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/14613161\" rel=\"nofollow\">such a client. Even if you don\\'t use its web interface, it is bad. It has terrible spam filtering, does not support IMAP (at least to my knowledge), has poor <a href=\"http://edwardkhoo.com/hotmail-yahoo-gmail-attachment-size-limit/\" rel=\"nofollow\">file size limits… Get an account on a serious mail provider such as Gmail or Y!mail: web interface is excellent, quotas are much higher, attachments size is twice as big, the spam filtering is great, and they support IMAP.Use <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Message_Access_Protocol#Advantages_over_POP\" rel=\"nofollow\">IMAP. We all agree that emails are most of the time critical pieces of information, especially in a business setting. IMAP will let you synchronize state (such as read / flagged), and keep a copy of all mails on the server. This way, you will get three backups: one online, safe on your provider\\'s server. One synchronized, on your main computer. One offline, in case of an accidental deletion, in the Time Machine backup you\\'ve set up in #1.',\n",

       "   {'utterance': 'Thanks for your detailed reply. Initial thoughts: (1) of course back-ups should be made, but it\\'s not my computer - I work with the system as it is presented to me. Of course, I should have taken a backup before fiddling - now I know! (2) My friend uses Hotmail/POP3, and I don\\'t want to change it. (3) Good idea. Once I\\'d switched from domain forwarding (to Hotmail) to using the email services on the new domains, I used IMAP for this, which sit alongside the Hotmail/POP3 configuration perfectly happily.I disagree with your assessment about using \"hotmail\\'s SMTP servers to send a mail pretending to come from an address that is not from hotmail\" - this is a common configuration that I\\'ve used many a time (though not with Hotmail). Authenticated SMTP makes it very easy to send mail with different From/Reply-To headers - if spamming occurs, the SMTP server owner will respond to abuse complaints by deactivating the SMTP credentials.Since this does answer my question, you get the +100... thank you again. I\\'ll give the tick to @afragen simply because that was very useful as well, hope that\\'s ok!Incidentally, I am led to believe that Apple now knows about these bug(s). Any ideas if I can track their progress? I presume they don\\'t have a public bug tracker!',\n",

The reason is we do not want to download the app (especially if it has a large file size, like 1GB).    For example, User 1 has purchased 'Scrabble' and User 2 has also purchased 'Scrabble'. User 1 has a good internet connection and finished downloading. User 2 has a bad internet connection. In this case, User 2 would benefit by copying the .ipa file to his computer (if Apple allows). Since both users have purchased the application, it is not piracy or illegal.I just don't have two accounts to try and I don't know where to look for the answer.

(in iTunes click on 'Store' > 'Authorize this computer')If two people want to use the same app they don't need to both download the app. They don't even have to both purchase the app. They can share the .ipa file if they authorize each other's computers.In the situation you present - where user 2 also bought the app but didn't download it - I think he would still need to authorize his computer with the apple id of user 1 in iTunes. That's because I think the identity (apple id) of the buyer/downloader of the app is stored in the .ipa file, but I'm not 100% certain about that.\",\n",

(I\\'ve put the text, without the screenshots, below)We\\'re going to enable an extra keyboard on your iphone, and show you how to use it to get the symbols out.Step 1: Switch on the keyboardNagivate to Settings->General->International->Keyboards->Add New Keyboard  and choose \\'Japanese, Ten Key\\'.   Once it\\'s selected, your Keyboards page should look a little like this:Step 2: How to access and ^_^ symbolsNow open up a typing screen (we\\'re using SMS in this example). You\\'ll notice a globe has appeared between the \\'123\\' button and the spacebar, this button switches between international keyboards.Make sure that you are in the text window (rather than the number window shown in the screenshot, and press our new globe button.  You\\'ll find yourself on a japansese page (press it again to go back).   Should look like the screenshot belowOf interest here is the \\'^_^\\' button on the bottom row. That gives you access to a massive range of smilies - it\\'s not the main point of this tip, but it\\'s pretty handy...  two photos belowStep 3: Actually putting the icons inSo now the final part - from the Japanses ten key keyboard, press the \\'ABC\\' key twice. You should find yourself on a numbers page. Looks like this:You\\'re now going to press and hold the \\'1\\' key.  You\\'ll see a star appear to the left: slide over and press it, if you want a star, you\\'re done. But if you want more symbols, press the arrow at the end for more of a range.There\\'s lots more symbols around that area, feel free to have a play.  Have fun!',\n",

Pages does include a preview in its saves, and \"Include preview in document by default\" is checked.What\\'s happening, and is there any way I can get around it without use of an iPad or iPhone?',\n",

It abstracts most of the core hardware, timing, message passing and memory handling. What most people notice in Activity Monitor is that <code>kernel_task</code> accumulates all the CPU time for input/output (i/o) processing delays and calculations as well as scheduling overhead of processes and threads. Similarly - it accumulates all memory allocations that are not in the user space. On the 2014 and newer Macs, this task exists to throttle the CPU - when the temperatures in the processor are too warm, kernel task is assigned \"no work\" and shows high CPU busy to let the processor idle and not overheat the computer. This is most noticeable on the portable line - especially the MacBook without any sort of fan or blower to cool the processor. Apple warns of this to potential kernel programmers in <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Darwin/Conceptual/KernelProgramming/keepout/keepout.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000905-CH205-TPXREF108\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"Why you should stay away from programming in the Kernel\" that disabling cooling will cause permanent irreparable hardware damage.<blockquote>  To summarize, kernel programming is an immense responsibility. You must be exceptionally careful to ensure that your code does not cause the system to crash, does not provide any unauthorized user access to someone else’s files or memory, does not introduce remote or local root exploits, and does not cause inadvertent data loss or corruption.</blockquote>If you watch it after a reboot you will see it starts with minimal RAM and CPU needs and instead grows only when other programs run and need the system services. To slim it down, shut off unneeded ports (WiFi, bluetooth, etc... ) as well as idle / unused programs. If things don\\'t settle down, consider rebooting to ensure no task is stuck or leaking memory.  If you have programs doing real work, they will cause the kernel to use both memory and processor time - just watch as you start things to see which other programs are causing this behavior. It\\'s rarely an issue with the kernel - even with badly performing programs - that can\\'t be solved by logging out and back in again. The kernel_task cleans up well and generally takes care to only use the resources needed by the workload.',\n",

You will be able to choose whichever partition you want to install onto, and switch between each by pressing ⌥ on startup.However, please note that this is not compatible with Bootcamp. I.e. you won\\'t be able to have a Windows partition, at least not with Bootcamp (you\\'d need a solution like rEFIt).Regarding whether you\\'d need to buy OS X again or not: as per the <a href=\"http://store.apple.com/Catalog/US/Images/MacOSX.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">OS X EULA:<blockquote>  This License does not allow the Apple Software to exist on more than one computer at a time</blockquote>…which I\\'d take for “it may exist several times on the same computer at a time”.I know that\\'s not what you asked for, so I\\'ll keep it as an aside, but I can\\'t resist saying it: this “partitioning” habit really is a switcher thing. There\\'s no need for that under OS X, especially if you fully encrypt each partition (which I\\'m curious about, by the way).The only reason I personally have two partitions is because I am totally dependent on my machine for my daily work, and I keep another OS in case of system corruption. But I aliased my user folder on the emergency partition to the one on the main drive, as an OS without my data is as useless as no computer. This fear of “a trojan” that would kill your system is irrational, and this setup will cost you much more in terms of maintenance (rebooting, keeping two systems updated in parallel…) than the advantages it will bring.',\n",

On my PC, when I move the mouse, the movement is smooth, and follow my hand moves. No matter if the move is large or small, the cursor goes exactly where I send it.On my Mac, when I move the mouse, it seems to do what I want on large moves, but on little moves the cursor does not respond as well as on the PC. It seems to slow down, as if it had missed some move instructions, as if it was responding only one on two impulsions.For example, when I try to catch the cross to close a window, I have no difficulties to reach the cross area, but to put the mouse exactly on it to close the window, it\\'s as if I were moving the mouse on a badly responding surface. It\\'s hard to reach the cross, like if the mouse was suddenly 2 times slower. Same problem to put the cursor beetween 2 letters on a text to make a precise selection, and other similar things. It\\'s a nightmare!I had tried many settings into the mouse control panel but it does not change anything on this problem.I have also tried 3 other mouses, one wireless Logitech Mac OS compatible, one wired Microsoft and one wired Trust: all have the same problem.What is happening? Do you know how may I solve this issue? ',\n",

       "   {'utterance': 'It seems like what you are referring to is not a problem with your mouse (as you\\'ve tried several). I\\'ll also rule out the silly possibility that you are using all those mouses on a sub-optimal surface, like glass or uneven and rough wood, etc. I think you\\'re simply experiencing the effect of different mouse acceleration algorithms between different operating systems.As the physical hand/mouse movement cannot practically be mapped 1:1 to the cursor movement (you\\'d need a trackpad as big as the screen!), some kind of mapping algorithm between the hand movement and cursor movement is necessary. Mac by default implements it so that slow hand movement maps to a very slow cursor movement (for precise targeting), and a relatively fast hand movement maps to a very fast cursor movement (for moving quickly in a general direction but without fine-level accuracy). On Win machines a bit of this kind of acceleration also exists but it is not nearly as pronounced as it is in OS X. Some Win users switching to a Mac might find this maddening as their muscles and motor skills are used to something different. But same is true for a Mac user switching to Win. I.e. a Mac user might feel that mouse is traveling way to slow when reaching distant parts of the screen, and it\\'s harder to do fine targeting in a small area. The Mac way does seem to work better the larger the displays are since it\\'s benefits are more obvious in that case.The good news is that if you just give it a week or two of constant usage, your muscles will likely get used to it and you won\\'t perceive a problem at all. Based on your description, you might want to increase you mouse speed a bit though, to split the difference between big broad moves, and tiny, precise ones.As a last resort, there are apps like Controller Mate:<a href=\"http://www.orderedbytes.com/controllermate/help/?show=configaccel\">http://www.orderedbytes.com/controllermate/help/?show=configaccel that let you adjust the acceleration algorithm used yourself.',\n",

My reasoning is that DiskWarrior is non-destructive and allows you to preview the \"repaired\" drive before committing to changes. If you absolutely can\\'t or won\\'t use DiskWarrior, at least use Disk Utilities \"verify\" mode before attempting the repair.Unix Gurus might advocate using fsck instead of Disk Utility but I prefer the GUI approach. I would also advocate casting a suspicious eye on any disk that you\\'ve had to use drastic methods to recover. Given the age of the computer in question, and assuming an original disk drive, my tendency would be to immediately transfer recovered information to a new disk and install that into the computer. In the old days I might put the old disk to work as a \"shuttle\" drive but in this era of keychain jump drives and DropBox I\\'d just strip it for bits or send it to the ewaste recycler. ',\n",

I\\'ve searched all over to figure out what might be causing this but I haven\\'t had much lock, possibly because the symptoms are so vague (\"some songs cut off\", etc.)My music collection, which is always pretty much filling the device, is 100% MP3 from a wide variety of sources (ripped, bought from Napster, etc.) and everything plays fine in Winamp on my PC so it doesn\\'t seem as if the files themselves are completely corrupted. My guess is that there is something about the files that the iPod is choking on but I can\\'t figure out what that might be. If I\\'m lucky it\\'s some weird tagging quirk (i.e., can be fixed in the individual files) but I really just don\\'t know, and it seems to be happening on an increasing number of files, including files that played just fine before. Sometimes an entire album or artist will consist of files that cut off. If this is just some known issue, do the latest iPod Classics (Generation 6, 160GB hard drives) still have this issue?

       "   {'utterance': 'There are many types of DVI adapter, I could type a load of stuff or just point you at <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Visual_Interface\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Wikipedia.The key point is that there is no such thing as a DVI adapter.  It\\'s just a generic term that covers the overall outline of the cable end, but what you really have is either a DVI-I or DVI-D adapter, in either Single or Dual link capability.  Or it may be a DVI-A.  Or there are others...!It\\'s possible that your splitter cable must be of the dual link types, characterised by the longer horizontal bar pin, and your Thunderbolt adapter may or may not be.  Shouldn\\'t matter which type, either I (Integrated with analogue signal in the pins above/below the horizontal bar in addition to digital) or D (Digital only) as I imagine you are not subsequently adapting them down to DSUB further down the line, the only thing that matters is if they are both dual link.So it looks like you need a Thunderbolt/MiniDisplayPort to DVI Dual link - the official apple one is the digital only one without the analogue pins (DVI-D Dual Link), and thus should work, if you are worrying that you do not have the same pinout (i.e. you have DVI-I Dual Link on your splitter, and it looks as though the analogue ones have nothing to connect to) then don\\'t worry, it won\\'t need them.EDIT - Additional InfoAfter the comments, I have decided that you have a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMS-59\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">DMS-59 connector that looks like this:So what you really need is a MiniDisplay > DMS-59 adapter, and my google-fu suggests that this is not looking like a possibility, I think you would be better served abandoning this cable, and looking for a total replacement, Mini Display Port > 2 x DVI (Single is fine, I or D if you have 2 ports).  This may also be a pain to find, and you may end up needing a MDP/Thunderbolt to Dual Link DVI, followed by a Dual Link DVI > 2 X Single Link DVI splitter cable!',\n",

However, it didn\\'t help me either.Transmit offers two options:  two-way sync between local and remote folder;mount SFTP to the filesystem.Alas, its two-way sync is manual and has to be invoked by pressing a button.<br>(I could probably get around this by writing some clever AppleScript—but I don\\'t know it.)SFTP mounting is great—unfortunately, it has major disadvantages: file searching is predictably slow and there seems to be no way to tell Transmit that files have changed on server. You need to unmount and mount again to see the remote changes. This makes branches impossible to work with.I\\'m really confused now and I don\\'t feel like wasting a couple of hours on a wrong solution. I\\'m open to suggestions for a tool to improve my workflow.Here\\'s what I found so\\xa0far.

       "  'utterances': [{'utterance': 'We take a lot of pictures, and it would be very convenient for us if we were able to organize all of our pictures into one massive, remote \"<a href=\"http://www.apple.com/aperture/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Aperture image repository.\" So, I got this idea to get a <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/ca/macmini/server/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mac mini server which could host all of our pictures, and possibly set it up to \"replicate\" (in whole or in parts) to several Macs via our local area network.The basic goal would be to set this up so that several Macs can \"connect to\" and work with one remote image repository, without needing to have the files locally on their local harddrives. And possibly download selected images when needed.I am familiar with programming and scripting for Mac OS X, so it is okay if the solution involves some light programming. I just wanted to check first if anyone here knows if this is something Mac OS X Server and Aperture can do \"out-of-the-box?\" Have any of you set up something like this, and if so, how is it working? Do you have any better suggestions on how to do this?One other thing that I thought about was to set up a <a href=\"http://git-scm.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Git or <a href=\"http://mercurial.selenic.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mercurial repository on the Mac mini server, and check all the pictures into that, and basically check stuff out on the separate machines locally when needed. This could work as well, but I\\'m afraid this solution might be a little bit \"overkill\" and add too much \"headachey.\"I don\\'t own a Mac mini yet, so I can\\'t play around with it to figure it out. The answers to this question will help me decide if we should buy a server or not. Oh, and I am aware of <a href=\"https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/27370/using-mac-mini-as-an-iphoto-server\">this question, which is similar, but I would like to know how well this would work with Aperture.Thanks in advance!Update:I found <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3618447/using-git-for-images\">this post on StackOverflow, talking about using Git as an image repo. Adding it here, for future reference.',\n",

Using such tools you can make certain folders public or private. Also you can just setup an FTP to load files directly to the site including direct from your phone or camera using eyefi card.

HDMI and DVI share almost identical digital video signals, so any HDMI to DVI adapter (like the included one) has few (if any) conversion chips in it and the output DVI port will be DVI-D (digital only). DVI to VGA adapters also don\\'t have conversion chips because they use DVI-I or DVI-A ports (A is analog only and I id both analog and digital): they take the DVI analog signal and move it straight to the VGA port. Unfortunately, that means that you cannot go from HDMI to VGA via DVI.

Other than quality, is there something inherent to music extracted/ripped digitally from a CD that lends itself to easier analysis for matching?UPDATE:  I found this <a href=\"https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3507807?start=0&amp;tstart=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">thread at Apple Support communities which contains strong anecdotal evidence that audio recorded from vinyl LP can be matched.

And I\\'m afraid they are quite obvious about it: <blockquote>  One of the big questions about Apple’s upcoming iTunes Match is how  the online music service will handle songs acquired from non-standard  sources, like analog LPs, or yes, file-sharing networks.    Coming this fall, iTunes Match will scan your iTunes library and make  available in the cloud all the songs you’ve purchased online or ripped  from CDs.</blockquote>When you read through the post, it became clear to me Apple didn\\'t left any gaps where you could turn your old, analog material into the cloud. You must have bought the item before (either in the iTunes Store or either on CD)...Maybe some geniuses can find a workaround, but I don\\'t think so. If you add a song from your analog media, iTunes Match won\\'t be able to match the song, but it will upload it to the cloud anyway so you can download it on another device!',\n",

Your process may be slightly more difficult because you want to have mostly everything sync from a new computer. This will be a lot easier to explain/walk through if you were almost starting from scratch on the iPhone, or just adding a new syncing device. So for some preliminary work, you will at least need to:Make sure you are using iOS 5Have iTunes 10.5 at least installedMake sure you are ok possibly loosing backups. Since this is complicated now (iCloud vs iTunes backup, etc), its really outside the scope. Are ok using Wifi SyncMake sure that your MacBook Air has the content you want to sync to the device on it.At this point, im assuming the above has been done. On the Mini, plug in the iPhone and make sure Wifi Sync is enabled. Also disable all other content sync except for music.Unplug from Mini, and plug into a charger (just to be safe) and test wifi syncing.Make sure the sync is fully complete on your Mini.On your Air, the iPhone should now show up, as long as they are on the same network. Setup sync on the MacBook Air, and select the content that you wish to sync (as in, everything except music).Click Apply, so the sync starts. At that point, you should be done. On the iPhone, if you go to Settings -> General -> iTunes Wifi Sync, it should now show the Mac Mini syncing music, and the MacBook Air syncing apps/photos/etc. I also had to restart my phone for this to show up correctly.

It can easily lead to confusion if you delete something from one library, because it won\\'t be removed from the other.To share the folder, go to System Preferences, Sharing, and select File Sharing.

       "   {'utterance': '<blockquote>  What is the benefit of using flash memory in the Macbook Air?  How does the use flash memory compare to SSDs? What are the benefits?</blockquote>The Macbook Air uses an SSD.  Apple markets it as merely flash memory because in the consumer market there are only two storage types - flash and hard drives. The typical consumer Apple is aiming for does not know what SSD is, nor do they care.  But they do know what a \"flash drive\" is, and due to aggressive marketing they believe it\\'s better than the alternative.It\\'s a custom form-factor SSD, but it uses a SATA flash controller, and the Air reads it just as if it were any other SATA drive.  OS X does, however, understand it as an SSD and treats it slightly differently from a hard drive in order to use it to its full potential, but in every other respect it\\'s just a custom form factor SSD.The reason Apple uses a custom form factor SSD is for size, weight, and - most important to Apple - cost.They have both Toshiba and Samsung on the line for supplying these SSDs.  When they get a poor price from one, they go to the other.  They need this because the SSD is one of the few things in the Air that requires custom PCB layout and comes from multiple suppliers. The pinouts and circuitry are different between the samsung and toshiba flash controllers, so they can\\'t build them into the main PCB as Apple would prefer, without locking them into one vendor or the other.The flash market is so volatile right now that they can\\'t lock themselves into just one supplier, especially since some 80% of Apple\\'s revenue comes from products that use copious amounts of flash.  If they thought they could get a better price manufacturing their own flash, they\\'d have their own plant - or ten.  Instead it\\'s cheaper to play the major flash producers against each other to get the lowest cost.So:The Storage in the Air is a SATA interfaced SSDIt\\'s not on the main PCB to give them the ability to use different parts from different suppliersIt\\'s not a 2.5\", 1.8\", or SATA slim interface because they needed it to be smaller - they designed their own interface, but it\\'s still SATA, just with a different low insertion force connectorThey aren\\'t using the latest and greatest chipsets due to cost and power consumptionThey aren\\'t using hard drives due to size, weight, and power consumption',\n",

This actually works pretty well, except for when it comes to using the Function keys (especially F10 and F11 for debugging).

You can hold down the 'fn' key and get access to these, and sometimes that doesn't even work directly, you have to hold down Command too. This slows me down quite a bit. I have built up some serious muscle memory for Visual Studio key commands, and would like to replicate them as close as possible through Remote Desktop. I am looking for a workflow that will:Allow me to RDP into a Windows machine (Windows 7 if that matters)Customize key commands JUST for that application, so that if RDP is the current application, hitting F10 will interact with the debugger in my RDP connection, and not mute my MacIf I can't map those exact keys, at least have a way to map two unused keys to the similar function key in the RDP session (as in, if I could map F10 and F11 to F16 and F17 respectively, that could work. It looks like Microsoft's RDP client allows you to change key commands, but not add new ones.

By the time the blood gets to the extremity - the pulse is less strong so this is one of the worst areas to try to detect pulses (but it\\'s very convenient and the skin is fairly translucent to the LED flash and oxygenated blood does reflect the light so it does work fairly well in some body types).I like the <a href=\"http://www.wahoofitness.com/Products/Wahoo-Fitness-Wahoo-Blue-HR-Heart-Rate-Strap-for-iPhone-4S.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\">wahoo fitness blue heart rate belt and especially the <a href=\"http://www.mioglobal.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mio Link wrist band, so the market for hardware custom designed for this should overtake any software that runs on iOS directly and uses the camera for measurement.

Every other time it would say it could either not detect a finger, or it started detecting the pulse, but then never finished the process.When it did work, though, the results were surprisingly similar to my other heart rate monitor. After performing 5 (non-scientific) tests, it was off by an average of only 1.26%. Had it worked more consistently, I would have tried it out more than 5 times.A few notes:While it is beeping and gathering info, the heart rate it shows is usually way off from your actual heart rate. Sometimes it\\'s almost exactly half your real heart rate.The final heart rate it outputs is usually very close to your actual heart rate.Therefore, you should only trust the last heart rate value it outputs (i.e. the average).',\n",

Try searching google for \"ipad repair\" \"ipad battery replacement\" \"ipod dock repair part\" and you should have a number of sources for parts or service.iFixit has reasonably good guides for disassembly and repair, and the iPad first generation is notably easier to repair than the 2nd and 3rd generation iPads.  <a href=\"http://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Installing-iPad-3G-Battery-Replacement/3186/1\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Installing-iPad-3G-Battery-Replacement/3186/1<a href=\"http://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Installing-iPad-3G-Dock-Connector-Cable/3187/1\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Installing-iPad-3G-Dock-Connector-Cable/3187/1The only thing between the charger and the battery is the dock connector/flex cable.

If that doesn\\'t fix it, and a software refresh doesn\\'t fix it, then there\\'s a problem with the main logic board, and replacing that is expensive - might as well get the iPad 2 instead.  Used iPad gen 1 and gen 2 are pretty inexpensive as people are upgrading, so it might not even be worth your time and expenses to fix it.

       "   {'utterance': 'The Apple MFI NDA requires that accessory developers not divulge any information about the device protocols, security chip, interface, etc.However, device manufacturers are allowed to create libraries and SDKs that others can use to release apps that use their device.One example is Redpark, for instance I have a few of their serial cables:<a href=\"http://www.redpark.com/c2db9.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.redpark.com/c2db9.htmlYou have access to as much of the device as they permit <a href=\"http://www.redpark.com/c2db9_Downloads.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">through their SDK, and you can release apps using that SDK that works with their device.  You can search the app store for \"redpark\" and find many apps that use their various iOS cables.So yes, it is possible - nothing in the Apple NDA prevents them from disclosing and providing their API to others.  They simply cannot disclose Apple\\'s protocol/API/interface to others.Do note that Apple requires a company to submit device samples and use cases for MFI approval, and it appears they don\\'t allow many developers to develop devices for which they plan to release SDKs.  There have been efforts to create universal infrared remote accessories for instance that haven\\'t been opened even though the developers originally intended to provide an SDK. One I discussed this with indicated that Apple wouldn\\'t approve their device unless it was tied to one, and only one app - theirs.  I understand in cases such as redpark the developers made the cables for specific customers and specific apps first, then started making generic cables for generic apps after initial approval.So there still may be some reluctance on the part of Apple to allow developers to design open API devices.While your question is about MFi accesories, a number of third party accessories have come out which are not MFi.  Many use Wifi or the audio jack to communicate with their iOS apps, such as <a href=\"http://www.60beat.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.60beat.com/ .  Several credit card readers plug into the audio jack.  Not all of them give their SDK/API freely, but you can always ask.  ',\n",

(The execute permission of a directory is sometimes thought of as the search permission. You need the x in order to be allowed access to the information about the contents of the directory.)You can also view permissions from Finder by selecting the folder and performing Get Info… from the file menu (or ⌘+i), but you won\\'t get as much information.You\\'ll find more information about accessing and interpreting file permissions in the Apple Knowledgebase: <a href=\"http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2963\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Troubleshooting permissions issues in Mac OS XIf you\\'re permissions differ from those shown here, you can try to Repair Permissions using Disk Utility (this doesn\\'t require a restart or booting from a different volume) or, if you\\'re comfortable, change the permissions of the Mail folder to match those shown using the <code>chmod</code> command.

So why is it saying I'm low on disk space? Lion also says sometimes that I'm low on disk space. This often happens when spotlight finishes indexing, I guess then system think it's low on disk space (even though I have 9 gb free at that point), then it appears that spotlight trashes its index, systems becomes smooth again, spotlight re-indexes, and same thing happens again. My theory so far is that if I have 16GB RAM, then the OS is for some reason trying to reserve atleast 16GB Swap Space on disk 'just in case I run out of the 16GB RAM'. Is this true? Does this make sense? I really don't want to free up more hard drive space. I already have a 128GB SSD which is small enough as is, and 16GB RAM should be plenty enough for the OS' memory needs.

The JPG one seems fairly straightforward; if I have a library with only one thing in it, it's just a JPG with a big header in front of it. The 64Segment file seems to have bitmaps? Not sure.BUT. The JPG in question is smaller than the preview I can get in iPhoto. If I import a photo then trash the imported version, I can still get a 360x240 preview. The JPG is 130x100 and the preview is clearly not an upscaling of the JPG.Oh. There's a thumbnails folder too, has what I'm looking for. As JPGs. Doy.\",\n",

Therefore, the launching applications as you mention will no longer work. It also may break other functions related to the OS, <a href=\"http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20110818105818950\" rel=\"noreferrer\">like the Mac App Store (to know whats installed, etc), and LaunchPad. If you still need an application launcher, you can use applications like <a href=\"http://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/index.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">LaunchBar and <a href=\"http://qsapp.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Quicksilver.After seeing your update (espc. on how to stop it indexing so much), there are two things to check:Are you running something like a virus scanner or other application constantly accessing files on your drive? This will force spotlight to keep indexing. A network share would also be a culprit. You can also filter what folders Spotlight should index, and by configuring this, can limit how much has to be indexed. Do do this, go to System Preferences -> Spotlight -> Privacy. Re-enabling would be running <pre><code>sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.metadata.mds.plist</code></pre>or <pre><code>sudo mdutil -a -i on</code></pre>',\n",

Such Apple peripheral devices include:      iPad  iPhone  Alluminum Wired Keyboard*  </blockquote>About wired keyboard we get the information:<blockquote>  *When connected to a computer that supports a connection of 1100 mA at 5 V, the first port on the keyboard to have a device or peripheral connected to it that requests standard 500mA power will receive that power. At that point, 100 mA at 5 V is available through the remaining port on this keyboard. This keyboard does not support extra power out of its two ports simultaneously; it requests extra power from the host computer to provide power out of either one of its two ports, then the second keyboard port receives the standard 500mA.    Note: Apple computers and displays that were introduced before 2007 support only 500 mA at 5 V from their ports and do not offer additional power.</blockquote>[<a href=\"https://support.apple.com/kb/HT4049\">source 1 from support.apple.com]As the wired keyboards can provide the minimum 500mA required by the iPad (just like older Macs can), it should be possible for it to power the iPad. However, it can not provide an additional current which would allow for faster charging.But, the new iPad can only charge in sleep mode when connected to a low powered USB hub:<blockquote>  The fastest way to charge your iPad is with the included 10W USB Power Adapter. iPad will also charge, although more slowly, when attached to a computer with a high-power USB port (many recent Mac computers) or with an iPhone Power Adapter. When attached to a computer via a standard USB port (most PCs or older Mac computers) iPad will charge, but only when it\\'s in sleep mode. Make sure your computer is on while charging iPad via USB. If iPad is connected to a computer that’s turned off or is in sleep or standby mode, the iPad battery will continue to drain.</blockquote>[<a href=\"https://support.apple.com/kb/HT4060\">source 2 from support.apple.com]',\n",

With regard to pre-allocating disk space, whether or not that is a performance penalty or not or how big an impact it has on you completely depends on your disk usage pattern.  It is a performance hit to expand the size of the drive.  If you rarely delete stuff from the disk but often add stuff (especially if you are running programs that are generating files, e.g. log files or transcoded media files) then you will suffer the most.  If you download big files, use them, and then delete them, you\\'ll probably end up with enough allocated free space to not notice the difference.You can also experiment with: Enable hard drive buffering.  This was critical for me when my VM was on a RAID 5 array, but otherwise didn\\'t matter.  VM settings -> Advanced, set \"Hard drive buffering\" to \"Enabled\"Enable/Disable Windows Pagefile.  For a real computer the best advice is to leave the pagefile active and system managed under Windows 7 (as opposed to XP, where it is probably better to remove it if you have enough RAM).  For a VM using a virtual disk it is not as clear cut, but easy enough to test.  Follow <a href=\"http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Change-the-size-of-virtual-memory\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">these directions to get to the page file settings but instead of choosing a size, select \"No paging file\".

So it\\'s reasonable to say that your iPod will never be able to connect to YouTube if you keep using the early 2008 iPhone OS 1.1.4.Google released the YouTube Data API (v2.0) around march 2008, after the iOS 1.1.4 was released.I fear the only solution to get your 1.1.4 device to play YouTube properly would be to get Google to turn the old API back on...

My problem is I never work strictly in one place (i.e. the office). I'm always at different locations, be it at home, with clients, or simply sitting outside at a coffee house. I always bring my laptop along and have looked into using VNC to access the mini remotely. However, I've read snippets of other users experiencing less-than-stellar speeds/performance when using VNC.iOS programming (i.e. Xcode) is the only tool I'd be using during remote connections - no surfing, downloading, game-playing, nothing graphics-intensive. The image of me typing a line of code and having Xcode lag two to three characters behind doesn't sit well as I really despise any type of lag. (I know. I'm picky.)So, I'm wondering:Would VNC allow me to feel as though I'm interacting with the mini itself and offer (at least almost) instantaneous feedback? Is there a better option out there with my budget?Any help is greatly appreciated, and apologies for the length; just wanted to be thorough. P.S. - If there's a way to simply plug the mini into my laptop and use its monitor, that would be better, though I haven't found that that's possible.\",\n",

One reason is that the +/- volume is on the right/left respectively (volume increases to the right in the display) and is easier to access with a finger than thumb on the bottom. Furthermore, since the volume button is used to operate the shutter on the camera, it should be that way up when taking photos.Is there a reason that apps (Apple-provided and third party) have the default orientation the other way?',\n",

       "   {'utterance': 'I was going to chalk it up to the developer just being lazy and selecting the default value and tab-completing when creating their app. However, I tried it out for myself (create a new iOS app project, edit the <code>$AppName-Info.plist</code> file and add the following new row):You can see that the first auto complete option for <code>Landscape</code> mode is <code>(left home button)</code>, meaning the developer had to consciously choose the second option for it to be right sided as in your app. This supports stuffe\\'s conjecture that this is done because most users are right handed.The screenshot above are the options for iPad. The iPhone has the same set, except for the second one, which is absent.AFAIK, Apple doesn\\'t advocate the use of a specific orientation as a default. Their <a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/Introduction/Introduction.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">iOS Human Interface Guidelines only say the following re: <a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/UEBestPractices/UEBestPractices.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006556-CH20-SW1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">orientation<blockquote>    Launch your app in your supported orientation, regardless of the current device orientation. For example, if your game or media-viewing application runs in landscape only, it’s appropriate to launch your app in landscape, even if the device is currently in portrait. This way, if people start your application in portrait, they know to rotate the device to landscape to view the content.  Support both variants of an orientation. For example, if your application runs only in landscape, people should be able to use it whether they’re holding the device with the Home button on the right or on the left. And, if people rotate the device 180 degrees while using your application, it’s best if you can respond by rotating your content 180 degrees.       On iPad, strive to satisfy users’ expectations by being able to run in all orientations. The large iPad screen mitigates people’s desire to rotate the device to landscape to “see more.” And, because people don’t pay much attention to the minimal frame of the device or the location of the Home button, they don’t view the device as having a default orientation. This lack of awareness of an app’s default orientation leads people to expect apps to run well in the device orientation they’re currently using. As much as possible, your application should encourage people to interact with iPad from any side by providing a great experience in all orientations.</blockquote>So as you can see, they don\\'t advocate for any particular orientation and encourage the developer to support all orientations. Also see <a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#qa/qa1588/_index.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this. However, <a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#technotes/tn2244/_index.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this technical documentation uses an example with code for right-oriented apps (i.e., home button on the right). So another explanation – apart from the developer\\'s own UX inclinations – is a copy-paste effect :)',\n",

In the case of the nano and similar FM radios that use the headphones as antennas, they use filters to couple the captured RF from the headphones into the FM receiver.  The filters usually consist of inductors and capacitors and permit only the RF energy to enter the FM receiver, while blocking the speaker output from the audio driver.  The audio driver may have similar filters that block out the FM energy from the audio driver.  The speakers are natural filters - they won\\'t react to signals much above 20kHz, and the radio RF is too small to make a difference even if they did perform at 95MHz.The cable company does the same thing when they send digital TV, analog TV, phone service, and internet to the user, and the user sends back pay per view requests, and internet and voice data.  They all use different bands of the total cable bandwidth and they are separated by filters on each end so the right data gets to the right spot, even though they all share one wire.  If you have DSL internet service and take the filters off your phones, you\\'ll notice additional noise on the line - because you are now letting the phone receive the DSL signal that was blocked by the filter.',\n",

I\\'ve also seen it called simply \"PC\" on another TV, and \"Just Scan\" on another.Check your HDTV\\'s settings ... chances are it has something like this and you aren\\'t aware of it.

I almost never had to wipe the film on my 3G to retain that frictionless feeling (it was just always there), but with my iPhone 4 (with no film) there are many times where I would need to wipe the screen to eliminate some of the friction, only to have it return after a few minutes of use.So if you are looking for a way to make your finger glide across the screen, I would definitely recommend using a screen protector.

In the event of a system crash or power failure, such  file systems are quicker to bring back online and less likely to  become corrupted.</blockquote>Taking that to one logical end, an external drive is by definition more likely to be removed from the system than an internal drive.  It\\'s not possible to remove your laptop drive and keep the OS running, but perfectly possible with something USB or Firewire attached for example.  As such you run a greater risk of changes that need to be written to the drive failing to complete should you remove the drive too quickly, or without following the correct eject procedures.Particularly if you use any form of caching, the data may be waiting to be written to the disk at the point of removal, thus losing your data.A journaled filesystem helps to prevent too much damage in these scenarios by keeping a log of all changes it needs to apply, and noting when they are successfully completed.  In this way it can examine the log on a restart and work out of there are outstanding changes that were never completed.  This is far faster than simply running a <code>chkdsk</code> or similar command to check the entire filesystem for problems which you would need to perform on a FAT32 file system.In addition to the protective side of things discussed above, is the fact that a HFS filesystem has all the Mac OS X hooks built in for automated indexing, backup, version control and so on that would not be possible on a FAT32 enabled filesystem.',\n",

I\\'m at a university where they do this on a much larger scale (think about 10–20k), so 400 should be possible — but, it also depends on the school\\'s IT infrastructure. The user directories and settings are all on a central server (or perhaps server farm, I don\\'t know) and each machine pulls the info when you login. You can login from any machine anywhere in the campus.Typically, the maximum number of accounts the server can have is limited by the storage space, and the number of simultaneous logins are typically limited by the amount of memory, processing power available and network bandwidth (the clients need to communicate with the server and a single server can only process a certain number of requests at a time). So a definite answer is hard to provide. The general approach is to spread the load (when demand spikes) over a cluster of servers or a server farm such that the end-user performance remains the same. Of course, no one expects the entire campus to be connecting all at once (there probably aren\\'t enough machines for that). You can read more load balancing <a href=\"https://help.apple.com/advancedserveradmin/mac/10.7/#apd5BB6AF5D-8734-46D3-8D7E-24156E0D0E20\" rel=\"nofollow\">here.<a href=\"https://discussions.apple.com/message/6885238#6885238\" rel=\"nofollow\">This discussion mentions a software enforced default limit of 1024 simultaneous connections, extendable up to 2048.

Ethernet (en0) had to be set up as a static IP (192.168.2.10) per the requirements for the device I am connecting to. All connections on the Ethernet card (en0) should be 192.168.2.xxx as specified above. WiFi (en1) is set up as DHCP to a router since their is no point in assigning it as a static for general purpose traffic. Ethernet (en0) is set up as priority over WiFi (en1).I would also like to keep this under the network location preferences if at all possible since I do not require this feature to be on all the time.I would really appreciate your help on this. No one I have talked to knows how to solve this. ',\n",

OS X will attempt to route packets to the first interface.  For packets meant for that network, it will work fine.  For packets not meant for that network it will see that it doesn\\'t have a gateway or route to the internet, and will route those to the next interface, which is internet connected.If your smaller network does have routers or a gateway that you need to access, you\\'ll have to edit your routing tables to tell OS X which IP addresses can be found on which networks.But I believe in your case the simple solution of putting the smaller network at a higher priority will work.',\n",

Evidence sources can  include your current location, visible WiFi networks, attached USB  devices, running applications and more.  You can even write your own  evidence sources using shell scripts!</blockquote>In a nutshell, you can give ControlPlane an \"evidence source\",  such as <blockquote>    WiFi, either networks within range or based on the network you are  currently connected to  </blockquote>Then perform a set of actions when entering (or leaving) a particular context, such as<blockquote>    Open any file, including starting Applications  Run a script, such as AppleScript or shell script  </blockquote>My thinking here is that if ControlPlane knows what your office wifi is called, you can create rules so that when you connect to it you start an application or shell script to start logging your hours. Then, when you disconnect, you stop the application or run another shell script to stop logging your hours. I realise this might not be the \"silver bullet\" solution you were looking for, but it might be worth a try. You\\'ll still have to find some kind of timer app/script, but thats probably the easier part of the problem :)',\n",

On my Apple TVs, the shows are sorted properly by series name, with the episodes listed when I select a series. However on my iPad (1st Gen, running IOS 5.1), when looking at my shared Library, I see an image for each episode, which when I click it, shows a list of the episodes for that season of the series. I can select and watch an episode from there.The problem is, I have way too many episodes to make this efficient, even to get to the Ds takes a lot of scrolling, and my list is cut off at the Ds.I have seen other questions that sort of address this issue, but not quite directly, and none of the answers solve my problem, although they do point me at the meta data for the shows. I have removed artwork from each episode of several series and added the same image to each episode of a series and I still get multiple images for a given season of a series.Any suggestions so I can group each series season under one (and only one) image when viewing the shared library on my iPad?edit 4/9 07:40 I checked on a 2nd Gen Apple TV, accessing the the same home sharing library, all TV shows were grouped appropriately.Most of my TV shows are ripped from DVDs. The ones purchased from iTunes do group correctly, There are a couple of ripped shows that seem to be grouped properly, but I have not yet figured out what is different about them.',\n",

       "   {'utterance': 'It\\'s all about the metadata ‚ the track information stored in each media file.A while back I had this problem with TV Shows ripped from DVD not displaying correctly, or not in the proper sort order, on my iPad. When I compared the metadata for my home-brewed files with those from files of episodes purchased from the the iTunes store, I discovered some differences. The solution that worked for me was to correct the metadata using the info pane for the media files in iTunes.To get started, open iTunes, select one of the TV episode files that\\'s giving you problems, and press ⌘ + i (or choose Get Info from the file menu).Start with the Info tab. Ideally your metadata will look something like this, with obvious differences (unless your file happens to be the same episode of The Big Bang Theory):Note that the track number corresponds to the episode numberNot all devices use the Info metadata for sorting though, your next stop is the Video tab:Episode ID could also be expressed as S2E8 but I prefer the cleaner, numerical method.Next, visit the Options tab to confirm that the Media Type is set to TV Show:.To assure consistency, you can select multiple files and edit common fields, such as Album (in the Info tab) or Show (in the Video tab) all at once.Finally, it\\'s sometimes useful to make change the criteria that iTunes uses to sort your media. You have guessed by now that the Sorting tab is the key to this operation:In the example above, alphabetical sorts by episode will place this episode with the L episodes, not in the T\\'s. This is useful for Movies, shows or bands beginning with The.The laborious process of manually entering  metadata for TV Episodes is the main reason for my using <a href=\"http://www.southpolesoftware.com/iVI/iVI.php\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">iVI to import DVDs.',\n",

It just works with PuTTY. You need to convert it first. I\\'ve found some instructions for converting it to a proper public/private key pair <a href=\"http://leadingedgescripts.co.uk/server-administration/how-to-convert-your-putty-ppk-private-key-to-a-normal-ssh-key-you-can-use-on-an-apple-mac/\">here. You\\'ll need to do this from your Windows machine.That will give you a private key, <code>key.ssh</code>, that will work with ssh on your Mac. Put the <code>key.ssh</code> file in your <code>~/.ssh/</code> directory. Make sure the permissions are correct:<pre><code>% chmod 400 ~/.ssh/key.ssh</code></pre>And then you can use it with your <code>~/.ssh/config</code> file like so:<pre><code>Host domain.com  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/key.ssh  User username</code></pre>If you no longer have access to your Windows machine you\\'ll need to generate a fresh public/private key pair to use with your web server.On Generating a Fresh Keypair To Use With Your MacHonestly, this is the best way to go here.Password-less authentication with shared keys requires that both machines have a piece of the shared/public key pieces. Here\\'s a complete recipe for setting up a shared key authentication scheme with two servers. It\\'s not really OS X-specific. It\\'s ssh-specific.These instructions assume host1 is your Mac and host2 is your web server.Generate a shared key on host1 (the shared key will be <code>/Users/you/.ssh/webserver.pub</code> and the private key will be <code>/Users/you/.ssh/webserver</code>):<pre><code>% ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -f ~/.ssh/webserverGenerating public/private rsa key pair.Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): Enter same passphrase again: Your identification has been saved in webserver.Your public key has been saved in webserver.pub.The key fingerprint is:98:b7:fa:0f:0d:e7:7f:50:cc:9b:b4:57:db:8d:b4:03 ian@Ian-Chesals-iMac.localThe key\\'s randomart image is:+--[ RSA 2048]----+|                 ||                 ||             o   ||       o    E * .||      o S .  = *=||       . *  . B.+||        o o  . o ||       . . .  .  ||      ..... ..   |+-----------------+</code></pre>Note: I didn\\'t enter a password for the key because I don\\'t want to have to use a password when I use the use.Now you need to append the <code>~/.ssh/webserver.pub</code> public key to the <code>~user/.ssh/authorized_keys</code> file on host2, your webserver.<pre><code>% ssh user@host2 \\'mkdir ~/.ssh;echo \\'`cat ~/.ssh/webserver.pub`\\' &gt;&gt; ~/.ssh/authorized_keys\\'</code></pre>For this to work you will need password access to the remote host. If you don\\'t have this you can give <code>~/.ssh/webserver.pub</code> to someone who does have access to the box and ask them to append it to the <code>authorized_keys</code> file for you perhaps. Or do it from your windows machine where you still have access.Now make sure your private key is safe on your Mac:<pre><code>% chmod 400 ~/.ssh/webserver*</code></pre>ssh can get complain-y if your private/public keypairs are world readable or writeable.Finally, you can add the following to your <code>~/.ssh/config</code> file to invoke the right key combination when you try to ssh in to your web server:<pre><code>Host domain.com  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/webserver  User username</code></pre>This will get you the password-less, keypair-based authentication you desire.',\n",

This is what is causing your machine to kernel panic when attempting to boot up normally. Safe mode is disabling the problematic \"thing\" and that is why you machine boots fine in safe mode. For more information on whats is going on when you boot in safe mode see <a href=\"http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1564\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mac OS X: What is Safe Boot, Safe Mode?, this may be valuable in diagnosing a cause of the kernel panic on start-up.So some next steps for you to take:First thing is figure out what is causing the kernel panic. Boot into safe mode and then open the Console program. Located at /Applications/Utilities/ConsoleWhen in the Console application look for the logs noted as PanicReporter, if we are lucky there should be one for each time you tried to boot the machine with a failed boot up. According to <a href=\"http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2546\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mac OS X: How to log a kernel panic, kernel panic logs for Leopard are stored in /Library/Logs/PanicReporter, so check for logs at that path in console.If you find logs do a quick read thru of of the first 20 or so lines and see if you recognize the name for a piece of hardware /software or something, feel free to post what you find as well to help in solving the problem.Once you have figured out what driver/s or extension/s is causing the problem the next step is to determine if it is a driver that you installed. If it is then look up how to remove and additionally re-install it or update it if it is something you need. If its a driver for something else built into the computer it could be indicating a hard ware failure for some kind of device, eg network card, etc. Or it could be just a corrupted software driver, and you may need to backup your date and re install the Mac OS.',\n",

We defeated Application Loader.The acid test: .itmsp folders still displayed as such after iTunes updateI recently updated Xcode:and can confirm that .itmsp folders were shown as folders during the update: and afterwards:A partial solution: The package will show contents when double clickedAs commented previously, the procedure detailed above won\\'t work with arbitrary folders that are displayed as packages by the Finder.However, if you just want to be able to double-click a package to open it, there is a way to do it with one <code>bash</code> script and Automator:The script creates a hidden, temporary folder inside the package, reveals it in the Finder (thus revealing the package as a folder) and then deletes the temporary folder.<blockquote>  Note:    The script could instead create a hidden, temporary file. However, I prefer to create a folder because <code>rmdir</code> only  deletes empty folders, while <code>rm</code> deletes any file, so if, for some  reason. the script wreaks havoc, only empty folders will be deleted,  which is probably not as bad as if files were deleted.</blockquote>Automator bundles the script into an application that will be associated with the package files.These are the steps to create such an application. I\\'ll use .itmsp files as a package type example in the explanation below:Open Automator in the Applications folder and select Application:Select Utilities in the Library list, select Run Shell Script and drag it to the pane on the right:Set Pass input to as arguments:Replace the default script contents with this:<pre><code>for f in \"$@\"; do    # If not dealing with a directory, exit    if [ ! -d \"$f\" ]; then exit; fi    # Create a temporary directory inside the itmsp \"file\"    tmpdir=\"$f/.itmspOpener$$\"    if mkdir $tmpdir; then        # Reveal in Finder        open -R $tmpdir        # Delete temporary file        rmdir $tmpdir    fidone</code></pre>Save the application as itmspOpener:Close Automator.Now you have an application that can open .itmsp files as folders if associated with it.There\\'s a cosmetic problem: as it stands, associated files will have the standard white document icon:Let\\'s fix this, too:Make sure Automator is closed.Select itmspOpener and show its contents:Locate Contents>Info.plist and open it with your favorite editor:Replace the value for this key in the <code>CFBundleDocumentTypes</code> array:<pre><code>&lt;key&gt;CFBundleTypeName&lt;/key&gt;&lt;string&gt;itmsp folder&lt;/string&gt;</code></pre>and add this key:<pre><code>&lt;key&gt;CFBundleTypeIconFile&lt;/key&gt;&lt;string&gt;folder&lt;/string&gt;</code></pre>Now, the section looks like this:Switch to the Finder, select a folder, press ⌘I, select the folder icon in the left top corner and copy it with ⌘C:Open Preview and select File>New from Clipboard. Save the file as <code>folder.icns</code>:Copy <code>folder.icns</code> to <code>itmspOpener/Contents/Resources</code>:Associate a .itmsp file to <code>itmspOpener</code> and press the button Change All...:The icon of .itmsp files should change to a folder, or at least I thought so: unfortunately, this wasn\\'t the case. So I moved the application itmspOpener to another location (I created a temporary folder on my Desktop, moved it there and back to my Desktop). That refreshed the icon information in the Finder:Now double click a .itmsp file and watch it open as a folder:',\n",

       "   {'utterance': 'Super highly unlikely you\\'ll find something like Time Machine, as that relies on file-system event logging that was custom made by Apple for Mac OS X.  You can, however, mount the Time Capsule\\'s disk drive as a file share using either AFP or SMB and use any program that will back up files to a file share, which is almost any program that backs up to disk, although beware of possible issues relating to ownership and permissions and unflushed buffers. Note that the following setup assumes you are using Airport Utility 5.6 or later but NOT Airport Utility 6.0.  If you are running Lion, 6.0 is installed by default but you can have both installed on your Mac and use both.  You can download Airport Utility 5.6 <a href=\"http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1482\" rel=\"nofollow\">from Apple. If your are on Snow Leopard or earlier, you probably already have 5.6.  Airport Utility 6.0 is greatly simplified and <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2012/01/31/in-pictures-airport-utility-6-0s-missing-features/\" rel=\"nofollow\">missing a ton of features that were available in 5.6.You need to explicitly enable File Sharing on the Time Capsule using the AirPort Utility.  From the AirPort Utility, select the Time Capsule, select Manual Setup, click on the Disks tab.  That should present you with the \"Disks\" pane, which should list the disks in and attached to the Time Capsule.  Note that like Disk Utility, the list is hierarchical, with drive partitions listed under drive devices.  My Time Capsule just has the internal drive with one partition.  (Click on the triangle next to \"Time Capsule Disk\" if you don\\'t see a partition name under it.)  Click on the partition name an the right panel changes to show you information about it, including giving you the ability to change its name.  This partition name is the root directory name for the SMB share, so make it short and without spaces. You should avoid hyphens, too, as sometimes hyphens are converted to spaces and sometimes spaces are converted to hyphens and it just gets unnecessarily confusing.  Underscores are OK.Now select the File Sharing panel to get to the rest of the configurations you need to set.With Time Capsule firmware version 7.6 and later you have 3 choices for password protection: you can use the same password for file sharing that you use fo Time Capsule, you can use a different password, or you can go all out and set up multiple users, each with their own password (and corresponding ownership and permissions features).  You also want to assign it to a Workgroup if you\\'re using SMB and you want your Linux and Windows machine and the Time Capsule to all be in the same workgroup.  The default workgroup name of \"WORKGROUP\" is the easiest way to go.To authenticate the SMB client for access to the Time Capsule when you have not set up individual users on the Time Capsule, you can use any (non-blank) username (it is ignored) as long as the password is correct.

Furthermore, I don't want to use my mobile carrier's data plan for doing background syncing/pushing, which my phone is doing 90% of the time when it's just sitting on the desk.So, long story short: When does the iPhone switch back to 3G even if it has WiFi signal?

The 3G radio consumes less battery power.<blockquote>  When does the iPhone switch back to 3G even if it has WiFi signal?</blockquote>As soon as you wake the phone it will being re-enabling sleep-disabled services like the WiFi radio. If you were previously joined to a wireless network that is still within range your phone should re-join that network a few seconds after you wake it up. Here is where problems can crop up - a burp in your router or temporary interference can prevent the WiFi from rejoining and if your data coverage is fast enough, you may not notice you are now on paid 3G data.

Or shortly after you put it back to sleep.<blockquote>  Can I modify this behavior somewhere?</blockquote>All of the Wi-Fi behaviour is set using the Settings app, under the Wi-Fi menu.You can turn the Wi-Fi radio off completely here. This will stop the phone from searching for wireless networks altogether and you\\'ll be running completely on cellular data services. (See #1 in screen shot)You can set what the phone does if the Wi-Fi radio is on, networks are detected, but it is not currently joined to any of them. In this circumstance the phone can prompt you to join a network or do nothing and let you manually join a network if you so desire. (See #2 in the screen shot).You can also manually chose a network here. And, if you\\'re currently joined to a network, you can click the > arrow next to its name to get the details and, if you want to, \"forget\" the network and disconnect from it.',\n",

If you are playing games in Boot Camp, having a separate fan controller is absolutely essential.It sounds like you may already have some damage to the GPU or motherboard.  If you are still under warranty or AppleCare, try to find an artifact that you can reproduce at the Genius bar and get the GPU/motherboard replaced.  Remember that the system will be cold when you get there, so it may take a while to reproduce heat problems.  The Geniuses like to use the iTunes visualizer as a test case, but if you have an offline game that produces  problems that will work as well.In any case, increasing the fan speed to keep the GPU temperature down while playing 3D games will greatly extend the life of your system.\",\n",

Yes - a string of MacBooks when ordered together will usually have sequential addresses (more so than sequential serial numbers in fact) - but over time, the iMacs seem mixed in with the Airs and the MacBook Pro.It could be that there is some encoding present and no-one has stumbled across which bits are coded with model numbers, but a simple sort of the MAC addresses has the devices all jumbled up. Perhaps if you can find someone that runs the mobile device management software for a very large company or school district and see if they are curious enough to see if a larger data set would yield some better results for you.I haven\\'t seen a case where a Mac and an iOS device share the same smaller block of MAC addresses, but I can\\'t even rule that out for you based on my experience running networks that log MAC address and are in a position to know what hardware is associated with which MAC address over the years.My guess is the addresses are issued sequentially rather than by final destination. It would make sense to dole out parts of each region to factories that are expected to make 5 or 10 thousand devices in the next month and onle issue more once the existing addresses are consumed. If so, we might have better luck trying to bin the numbers by approximate manufacturing date rather than by where it ends up in a shipping product. Also consider on the Mac end, <a href=\"https://discussions.apple.com/thread/1792921\">repairs often give a new MAC address to portables and even desktop Macs when the ethernet controller is replaced.',\n",

However, it\\'s much easier now using Time Machine, but you have a few options:Time MachineIf you don\\'t currently have a backup that can hold all your data, do yourself a favor and pick up a drive that can.  Time Machine should be built into the OS you\\'re currently running.Do the backup.  For 400 GB, you probably want to set it up before you go to sleep and let it run overnight.  Once  it\\'s complete, unmount the drive and unplug it from the computer.  Go through with the drive install and then install Lion.  When the computer reboots, before you start to work with the setup assistant, plug in the new drive.  At some point it will prompt you for a location from which to migrate data.  Select your backup.  Let it run for a while and when you get back, it will contain all the data you backed up, in a usable form.  This is my current favorite method for cloning user workstations.Super DuperIf you can\\'t get an external backup, you can use <a href=\"http://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">SuperDuper to create a full-system backup from the active system disk.  You\\'ll have the ability to trim the data to the size of the disk to which you\\'re copying in the interface.  This route is a little more technical and requires a bit more time hands-on.File CopyI wouldn\\'t recommend copying a user folder for a logged-in user due to open  preferences files.  You\\'ll get all kinds of \"File In Use\" errors and it will probably exit the copy prematurely.  Instead (if you\\'re dead-set on using this method - which I advise against) create a second admin user and copy the folder over into a temporary location before staging it into the actual <code>/Users/</code> location.  You\\'ll also need to make sure the permissions for the entire folder are set so that the user whose home you are copying can actually access and write to their files.  To do this, you can use the Finder\\'s <code>Get Info</code> on the folder and then add the user to have full permissions.  Once it\\'s staged into the <code>/Users/</code> folder, you can log back in to the main user and delete the secondary admin.  You may have permissions issues in the future using this method.All that said, it\\'s totally worth it to get an external to back up to for Time Machine to clone your new SSD from.',\n",

When I migrated to an SSD, I used the DVD-RW bay in my laptop as a mount for my old, larger drive.  Now I keep all my media on it.  That works pretty well.  One way for you to do that is to move the non-ssd to an enclosure and use it as a media disk as well, which should free up most of your space.I can't verify that this will occur on the initial install/restore process in the setup assistant, but apparently Migration Assistant (which the setup assistant's Time Machine portion is based on) will prompt you for data you want to omit.

An new finder window will open. There is one folder in there named Contents. Contents includes several files and folders, navigate to see the content of the folder Resources until you find a file named Reader.html. This is the file you want to edit. Most probably you will not have the rights to do so. Depending on your choice of text editor, you are asked for a admin password when opening the file or when you try to save it. I use the nice TextWrangler from BareBones and it opens the file without asking (it will do so later in the process).    Now edit the CSS to your liking and save the file.    Open Safari and check out how it looks.    And one more thing: With the next update of Safari your changes in Reader.html will most likely be overwritten. So you might want to keep a version of Reader.html at another location outside the application package Safari to re-implement your changes.</blockquote>As always, proceed with caution when modifying default applications and have backups of both any edited files as well as your important data.',\n",
